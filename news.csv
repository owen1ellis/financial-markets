US0640581007,BK,The shadow of Trump looms over a cautious Fed,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-shadow-of-trump-looms-over-a-cautious-fed-090041612.html,Yahoo Finance•6 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"The Federal Reserve will gather this week for its first meeting of 2025 under the looming shadow of a new US president who is alreadyposing challengesto the central bank with his words and possible actions.
Trump hinted at acoming clashwith Fed policymakers as he spoke virtually before the World Economic Forum last week, saying he would ""demand"" lower interest rates.
Trump doubled down on his comments later while talking to reporters, noting that he wants rates to come down ""a lot"" and that he thinks the Fed will listen to him. He said he expects to talk directly with Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""at the right time.""
Where Trump and Powellcould be at oddsis that Fed officials have sent multiple signals in the opposite direction, hinting that rates may not be changing for awhile after being lowered by a full percentage point at the end of 2024.
And investors are betting rates won't change at the Fed's policy meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, DC.
What Fed officials repeatedly have made clear in the run up to this meeting is that they are increasinglyconcernedabout signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025.
Some alsohave aired concernsbehind closed doors that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide even more upward price pressure.
In fact, Fed officials recentlylowered their forecasts for additional rate cutsin 2025 from four to two, due in part to their concerns about inflation and the economic effects of Trump's agenda.
Some watchers of the US economy are now raising the possibility that the Fed could even be forced to raise rates this year — a move that would surely invite Trump’s wrath.
Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told Yahoo Finance he doesn’t think the Fed will fire off the two cuts predicted.
""I think the odds of a hike are the same as the odds of a cut,"" he said, pointing to the potential for higher deficits and investments in AI driving the economy.
BNY CEORobin Vincetold Yahoo Finance he also thinks rate hikes are possible, but it's more likely the Fed will hold rates steady for awhile. If the Trump administration unveils new tariffs on China and the European Union, that opens more extreme possibilities.
""I think rate hikes are possible. Anything is possible. You've got to be prepared. Being resilient really matters,"" BNY (BK) CEORobin Vincetold Yahoo Finance at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland.
But hiking rates ""doesn't feel like the most likely outcome. To me, the Federal Reserve has been on a path that looks like they can pause for a little while and take stock of where things are.""
Nouriel Roubini, CEO of Roubini Macro Associates and professor emeritus for the Stern School of Business at New York University, said he sees no cuts happening this year but wouldn’t take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.
""The risk is the Fed that told us last year, 4 cuts this year, then in December said only 2 cuts. And now the markets are pricing maybe only 1 cut, there will be zero cuts,” said Roubini.
If core inflation goes higher, he added, a rate hike cannot be ruled out, even though that’s not his baseline. Tariffs, restrictions on immigration and high deficits could add more inflationary pressures.
""This stuff that can increase inflation … literally this year,"" he said.
Fed policymakers have suggested in their recent commentary that they want tomove slowlyin 2025, as they assess the impact of Trump's policies, even thoughsome do still expect rates to eventually fall further.
Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said earlier this month that the Fed's rate cut in December cut was the ""last step"" in the central bank's ""policy recalibration.""
Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid said recently that ""I believe we are near the point where the economy needs neither restriction nor support and that policy should be neutral.""
Schmid added that he is now in favor of adjusting rates ""gradually.""
Trump’s new comments last week suggested that he may not be so patient as he waits for rates to fall further, setting upa possible collision coursebetween Trump and Powell in the weeks or months ahead.
The president's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were not his first on the subject this year, either. At a Jan. 7 press conference, Trump also said ""interest rates are far too high.""
On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump regularly weighed in with criticisms of Powell, offering that the president should ""have a say"" in Fed decisions and that Powell has ""gotten it wrong a lot.""
In 2018 and 2019, Trump lobbed regular critiques at Powell — whom he appointed to the role — as the Fed raised rates and triggered a stock market sell-off that year,at one point likening the Fed chairto ""a golfer who can’t putt.""
After Trump’s win in November, Powell has also staked out seemingly immovable ground, saying there is “no legal authority” for him tobe removed before his term as chair ends in 2026.Trump said last month onNBC's Meet the Pressthat he has no plans to remove Powell before the chair's term is up.
Roubini warned that if the Fed lost its independence it would make inflation worse because he believes inflation expectations would rise and the bond market would send interest rates higher.
Even holding rates steady may result in a clash.
""I think that even no cuts, as opposed to raising rates, puts the Fed on a collision course with this administration because this administration wants easy money to strengthen economic growth,"" Roubini said.

US0640581007,BK,"Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) jumps 3.0% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-nyse-bk-130054737.html,Simply Wall St.•yesterday,Yahoo Finance,"If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, theThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation(NYSE:BK) share price is 92% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 55%.
The past week has proven to be lucrative for Bank of New York Mellon investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.
See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon
In his essayThe Superinvestors of Graham-and-DoddsvilleWarren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Bank of New York Mellon managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.9% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that Bank of New York Mellon has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out thisfreereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Bank of New York Mellon, it has a TSR of 122% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted thetotalshareholder return.
It's nice to see that Bank of New York Mellon shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

US0640581007,BK,Is Bank of New York Mellon (BK) Among Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top Stock Picks?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-bk-among-095637634.html,Insider Monkey•2 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"We recently published a list ofBillionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) stands against other Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks.
Mario Gabelli is a legendary American investor, renowned for his expertise in value investing and his focus on media, telecommunications, and consumer goods. As the founder and CEO ofGAMCO Investors, Gabelli has built a storied career, consistently delivering strong returns for investors while amassing significant wealth. He was born in 1942 in Italy to a family of modest means. His father was a schoolteacher, and the Gabelli family immigrated to the United States when Mario was a child. Settling in the Bronx, Gabelli became fluent in English while excelling academically. He attended Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA.
Gabelli’s early career began at Lyon, Lavey, and Bessemer, where he worked as a financial analyst before moving to Tudor Investment Corporation in the late 1960s. At Tudor, Gabelli developed a deep interest in media and entertainment stocks, recognizing that these sectors were undervalued and ripe for investment. Gabelli’s early years in finance provided him with a solid foundation in analyzing companies, market trends, and financial statements. In 1976, Gabelli founded Gabelli & Company — which would later become Gabelli Asset Management and then GAMCO Investors — with the goal of applying his value investing philosophy to select, often underappreciated companies.

Under Gabelli’s stewardship, the firm has delivered above-market returns, with Gabelli’s flagship Gabelli Equity Fund returning an average annualized return of 13% over several decades. Gabelli is an ardent advocate of value investing, a strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis, buying companies at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and holding them for the long term. One of Gabelli’s most notable achievements was his early recognition of the potential in media companies. He was one of the first investors to spot the potential of CBS, Time Warner, and Viacom, turning those investments into massive successes. Gabelli is particularly well-known for his focus on the telecommunications sectors as well. He has invested in companies like Comcast, Disney, and Liberty Media, often advocating for management changes and strategic restructuring to unlock value.

US0640581007,BK,"With EPS Growth And More, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Makes An Interesting Case",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eps-growth-more-bank-york-110033408.html,Simply Wall St.•5 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, likeBank of New York Mellon(NYSE:BK). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Bank of New York Mellon grew its EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Bank of New York Mellon's revenue this year is revenuefrom operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Bank of New York Mellon maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 6.7% to US$19b. That's a real positive.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Bank of New York Mellon'sfutureprofits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you cantake a peek at what the professionals are predicting.
Since Bank of New York Mellon has a market capitalisation of US$60b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$70m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.
One important encouraging feature of Bank of New York Mellon is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusivediscounted cashflow valuationof Bank of New York Mellon. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.
Although Bank of New York Mellon certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

""To see a government that's really focused on growth and being able to make the economy everything that it can be, because ultimately, as one of America's leading banks, we are focused on helping our customers to be able to grow and thrive. You know, that's what our platforms are all about,"" Vince says.
Asderegulation under Trumpis expected tobenefit the financial sector, Vince says he's ""not that concerned"" about the risks associated with loose regulation. ""We have to be vigilant that that doesn't happen. We need a strong, healthy financial system,"" he says, explaining, "" We've seen how the strong banks have been able to actually help the system over the course of the events ... We've been a force for strength in the economy, and that's actually the role that we should be playing.""
The CEO underlines, ""I'm looking forward. I'm thinking about the innovation. I'm thinking about the investment. I'm thinking about helping to make economies grow and our clients be successful.""

US0640581007,BK,Federal Reserve could hike rates if Trump tariffs unleash inflation: BNY CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-could-hike-rates-if-trump-tariffs-unleash-inflation-bny-ceo-151451559.html,Yahoo Finance•6 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — Investors should rule out nothing from the Federal Reserve in 2025 if the newly minted Trump administrationuncorks fresh tariffs on China and the European Union.

On his first day in office on Monday, Trump wasted no time stoking tariff concerns. He threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and possibly one as high as 100% on China if a deal on TikTok wasn't reached.
Bank stocks have been on apost-election upswingdespite the unknown of tariffs and their economic impact. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) is up 8% since Trump's win, while BNY shares have notched a 3% gain.
Investors have a dinner plate to choose from to explain the bullishness, even with macro concerns swirling.
Under the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) put forth a host of high-profile rules and saw yawning supervisory authority. Trump is expected to roll back that authority to free up the banks.
Meanwhile, deal activity is expected to pick up under Trump as regulations ease. That could help fuel the lucrative M&A departments of the big banks while also supporting broader market valuations and trading businesses.
And lastly, banks affected by the so-called Basel III endgame may be less so, paving the way for capital to be deployed for increased dividends and stock buybacks.
""I think the lesson that we've learned over the past 15 years is banks have added a lot of capital. Banks have added liquidity. The regulators have done a terrific job making the system stronger,"" Vince said.
""Let's go out and use it for the very purpose for which banks are created, which is to be able to help grow and help clients and individuals be able to be successful.""
""We also see scope for deregulation under the Trump administration, which should reinvigorate retail trading [benefiting brokers] and scope for private markets access into the retirement channel [benefiting alts],"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said.
""For the first time since the great financial crisis, the regulatory environment for large-cap banks is likely to stabilize and not get incrementally tougher, and our expectation is that the Fed may either sit on Basel endgame or implement a version of Basel endgame that is capital neutral.""
Graseck'stop picksfor financials include Citi (C), Barclays (BCS), and Robinhood (HOOD).
While the optimism has helped push up bank valuations, the sector itself had a bang-up fourth quarter, and CEOs at the major firms voiced optimism on the outlook for sales and profits.
Fourth quarter results for the big bankslike Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), and Citi (C) were powered by bumper sales in investment banking and trading businesses.
BNY put up a solid though less eye-popping showing, as it's a trust bank instead of a traditional investment bank.
Fourth quarter sales and adjusted earnings rose 11% and 33%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
""We rate Bank of New York Mellon overweight relative to trust bank peers due to: 1) outlook for positive operating leverage on overall basis; and 2) more diversified revenue mix with more areas for fee revenue growth. Bank of New York is also attractively valued,"" JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja wrote following BNY's earnings results.

Trump has indicated he plans a10% baseline tariffon all imports to the United States, with more significant targeted tariffs for some, like China. There has been debate about whether Trump willactually instate the significant tariffsor if therhetoric is a negotiation tactic.
""Tariffs are and always have been a tool of trade policy, and the president's made it very clear that he wants them to be used as part of trade policy,"" Vince says.
The CEO notes, ""I think if you put tariffs on top of everyday items that Americans are consuming, that they go to their local store, grocery store, or home goods store and buy, they can be inflationary. But at the same time, tariffs well applied can also make US businesses more competitive.""
Discussing what to expect from the Fed, Vince says, ""I don't think anybody should rule out anything,"" including a rate hike from the Fed. We're risk managers. It's our job to be prepared. It's our job to be agile,"" he says, adding, ""You've got to be able to work with Congress, with the incoming administration, with regulators, and you've got to be able to adjust.""

US0640581007,BK,Should BNY Mellon US Mid Cap Core Equity ETF (BKMC) Be on Your Investing Radar?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-us-mid-cap-112006581.html,Zacks•6 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the BNY Mellon US Mid Cap Core Equity ETF (BKMC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 04/09/2020.
The fund is sponsored by Bny Mellon. It has amassed assets over $543.43 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Mid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.
Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.49%.
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Dreyfus Institutional Pre accounts for about 0.62% of total assets, followed by Expand Energy Corp (EXE) and Packaging Corp Of America (PKG).
The top 10 holdings account for about 5.53% of total assets under management.
BKMC seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE GBS UNITED STATES 400 INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive GBS United States 400 Index intends to track the performance of the largest 400 mid cap companies from the US stock market and is based on the Solactive Global Benchmark Series.
The ETF return is roughly 3.67% so far this year and was up about 19.81% in the last one year (as of 01/21/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $89.34 and $110.43.
The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 19.05% for the trailing three-year period. With about 409 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
BNY Mellon US Mid Cap Core Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, BKMC is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF has $75.21 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF has $98.55 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

US0640581007,BK,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Great Choice,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170013711.html,Zacks•6 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look atThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BK that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.
For BK, shares are up 10.43% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry is up 7.92% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.3% compares favorably with the industry's 4.4% performance as well.
Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation have risen 10.76%, and are up 51.33% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 2.93% and 28.08%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to BK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BK is currently averaging 3,069,734 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with BK.
Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BK's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.57 to $6.86 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.
Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation on your short list.

US0640581007,BK,Bank Of New York Mellon's Differentiated Business Mix And NII Growth Signal Upside: Goldman Sachs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellons-differentiated-business-185634811.html,Benzinga•10 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation(NYSE:BK) shares aretrading slightly lower on Thursday.
Yesterday, the company reportedfourth-quarter 2024 results. The finance behemoth reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 (+33% YoY),beating the street view of $1.56.
Here are some analysts’ take on the stock:
Goldman Sachsanalyst Alexander Blostein reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, raising theprice forecast to $96 from $91.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woodsanalyst David Konrad maintained the Outperform rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $96.
Truist Securitiesanalyst David Smith maintained the Buy rating, with a price forecast of $91.
Goldman Sachs:The analyst sees the company’s 2025 and medium-term targets suggest a strong 10%+ EPS growth, not fully reflected in the stock’s 11X 2025 P/E.
Per the analyst, the management team is gaining credibility, which could lead to increased investor confidence and higher valuations.
Blostein writes that key factors supporting the Buy rating include better NII growth, which is 6% higher than consensus due to improved deposit levels, positive fee income growth driven by a differentiated business mix, and continued expense management with 1% – 2% growth expected in 2025.
The analyst sees potential for sustained positive operating leverage and appreciates the growing investor recognition of the fee growth potential. EPS estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 have been raised by the analyst to $7.09, $8.15, and $9.26, from $6.79, $7.81, and $8.79 respectively, reflecting higher growth compared to consensus.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:The analyst raised 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by $0.15 to $6.80 and $0.10 to $7.65, respectively, due to improved deposit behavior and higher NII expectations.
Per Konrad, while deposits are expected to moderate in 2025, the strong results in the second half of 2024 are projected to drive 5% NII growth in 2025.
Despite recent outperformance, the analyst sees a significant upside as the stock is trading in line with peers.
Truist Securities:The outlook for the year is neutral, with fees expected to rise YoY, the analyst writes.
Per Smith, a 5% increase in markets could add ~$70 million in annualized fees.
BNY plans to invest $0.5 billion, double its 2024 investment. The effective tax rate is expected to be 22% – 23%.
The analyst writes, by the first quarter of 2025, over half of the company’s workforce will operate on the platform model, with plans for 85% by year-end.
Price Action:BK shares are trading lower by 0.69% to $81.47 at last check Thursday.

US0640581007,BK,"BNY Mellon Stock Up 8% on Q4 Earnings Beat, AUM & Fee Income Rise",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-stock-8-q4-165100673.html,Zacks•10 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s BK fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Also, the figure reflected a jump of 33.3% from the prior-year quarter.Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.Further, BK’s total revenues grew 11.2% year over year to $4.85 billion. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.66 billion.The primary driver of the top line was an improvement in fee income and assets under custody and/or administration (AUC/A) and assets under management (AUM) balance.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteBNY Mellon shares jumped 8% during yesterday’s trading session.
Total fee revenues were $3.51 billion, up 9.3% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was particularly driven by all the components except distribution and servicing fees.BK’s investment services fees (the largest revenue component) grew 8.7% to $2.44 billion in the fourth quarter. Investment management and performance fees rose 8.7% to $808 million.The rise in both the abovementioned metrics was driven by improvement in AUM and AUC/A balances. As of Dec. 31, 2024, AUM was $2.03 trillion, up 3% year over year, and AUC/A was $52.1 trillion, up 9%. The growth primarily reflected higher market values driven by a global market rally in the quarter, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of a strong U.S. dollar.Similar to BK, its peers –JPMorganJPM andCitigroupC – witnessed improvements in non-interest income in the fourth quarter. This resulted in a rise in revenues for both companies.For BK, other fee income components, financing-related fees and foreign exchange revenues jumped 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, distribution and servicing fees declined 9.8%.Additionally, BK’s net interest income (NII) on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 8.4% to $1.20 billion on a year-over-year basis. The rise was driven by higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partly offset by changes in the deposit mix.Further, total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.36 billion for BNY Mellon, down 16%. The decline was due to a fall in costs related to staff charges, net occupancy charges, distribution and servicing costs, business development costs and bank assessment charges. Adjusted expenses rose 2.4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.19 billion.In the fourth quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company recorded a provision for credit losses of $20 million, declining 76.2% year over year. Likewise, JPM and C recorded a decline in their provisions for the quarter.  You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

US0640581007,BK,Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bank-york-mellon-corporation-164505451.html,Zacks•10 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 6.78% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.47 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.29% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.42% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.53%.
In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.88 is up 5.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, The Bank of New York Mellon's payout ratio is 34%, which means it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.
Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $6.61 per share, with earnings expected to increase 9.62% from the year ago period.
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.
Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BK is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Robin Vince
Thanks, Marius. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into our results, I want to address the ongoing wildfires affecting parts of Los Angeles. We're heartbroken by the tremendous loss being suffered by the community, where we have several officers. As always, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of our employees and clients located in the effective areas. And we have also committed matching employee donations to eligible nonprofits, providing relief and recovery to those impacted by the fires.Turning now to our quarterly update presentation, 2024 was an exciting year for BNY, and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. Building on the solid foundation that we laid in 2023, we accelerated the pace of our ongoing transformation and closed out 2024 with a strong performance, delivering record net income of $4.3 billion on record revenue of $18.6 billion, and generating a return on tangible common equity of 23% for the year.Aligned to our three strategic pillars, to be more for our clients, to run our company better, and to power our culture, at this time last year, we laid out a set of medium-term financial targets as well as our action plan to drive sustainably higher revenue growth over time. We're executing against these plans and targets every day.As you can see on page 3 of our presentation, we made very tangible progress in terms of delivery in 2024. For our clients, the rollout of our new commercial coverage model was an important milestone. Effectively cross selling and leveraging the breadth of our business platforms is the single most compelling growth opportunity for the company. And so our commercial model is designed to deliver from across the company at an accelerated pace, improve the client experience, and ultimately deepen our relationships. This is the operationalization of One BNY.But our growth is not just about more of the same. Delivering innovative solutions to the market that leverage the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY is another important way for us to be more for our clients and drive top-line growth. This is One BNY version 2.0. Our acquisition of Archer is a good example for BNY becoming an end-to-end solutions provider, in this case, across the entire managed account ecosystem, be it manufacturing in BNY investments, distribution through Pershing, or servicing through Archer.Over the course of 2024, we also developed numerous new client solutions, such as CollateralOne, Alts Bridge, a next-gen ETF servicing platform, and new capabilities on Wove. This new product momentum is an important investment for the years ahead. Continuing the investment theme, over the course of the year, we further increased our investments to drive both revenues and scalability, and we generated approximately $0.5 billion of efficiency savings as we continue to digitize workflows and begin to leverage new technologies, including AI.We also commenced the phased transition to our strategic platforms' operating model in the spring, and over the course of 2024 transitioned approximately 13,000 employees or roughly one-quarter of the company into this new way of working. Zooming out for a moment, the wrapper for much of our work is culture. Powering our culture remains essential to everything else, and we are starting to see the benefits of our people around the world working more closely together.Celebrating our company's 240th anniversary in 2024 with colleagues, clients, and many other stakeholders around the world felt even more special at a moment in which our people could start to see their hard work leaving a positive mark on this iconic institution. Considering the transformation underway at our company, we decided that the time was right last summer to simplify and modernize our brand and logo to improve the market's familiarity of who we are and what we do.The benefits of BNY's improved visibility in the market have also supported our recruiting efforts. Throughout the year, we've been successful in attracting top talent across the firm, from recruiting our largest intern and analyst classes to further rounding out our executive leadership team. And the targeted investments we'd be making in the employee experience across learning, benefits, and facilities are being recognized and valued by our people.Another important aspect of powering our culture is to deliver on our commitments. We've worked hard to say what we do and to do what we say. And so turning to page 4, I'm pleased that in 2024, we once again met or exceeded our financial goals for the year. We are confident that BNY can deliver positive operating leverage across a wide range of scenarios, and so we started 2024 determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective.That was an ambitious goal at the time, considering that our revenue outlook at the beginning of the year foresaw an approximately 10% NII headwind to largely offset growth in fee revenue. Therefore, we had to set up to keep expenses, excluding notable items, roughly flat while at the same time self-funding incremental investments in the business.Dermot will discuss the financials in more detail, but in summary, in 2024, we delivered 968 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 288 basis points, excluding notable items. We grew fee revenue by 6% year over year, and NII was down 1%, outperforming our outlook from the beginning of the year by approximately 9 percentage points. Despite higher-than-expected revenue, expenses were down 4% year over year on a reported basis and up 1%, excluding notable items.And finally, consistent with our outlook, we returned 102% of 2024 earnings to our shareholders. Taken together, we delivered record financial results in 2024. Significant positive operating leverage resulted in pre-tax margin expansion and improved profitability, and we delivered attractive capital returns to our shareholders, all of which underscored the execution of a reinvigorated BNY.But now, let's look forward on page 5. We are entering 2025 with strong momentum and determination to deliver further value for our clients and shareholders. BNY plays a central role in global capital markets with $52 trillion of AUCA, $14 trillion of debt serviced, $3 trillion of wealth assets, and $5.6 trillion of assets on our collateral management platform. We manage $2 trillion of AUM. And on an average day, we settle over $15 trillion worth of securities and roughly $2.5 trillion worth of payments for clients around the world.This exceptional client franchise and leadership across our diversified financial services platforms positions us well to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends, several of which we describe on the left-hand side of the page. Some of our fastest-growing businesses in 2024, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management, and Corporate Trust, demonstrate our gearing toward economic growth and higher capital markets activity, both public and private.And through Pershing and Wealth, we are a leader in serving one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, the US wealth market. Within that market, our wealth business is focused on the faster-growing ultra-high net worth space. Our Pershing business, on the other hand, leverages the size and scale of our platforms to power advisors' businesses, helping them navigate an increasingly complex operating environment using the power of our technology.Relevant for both retail and institutional investors, the trend toward private markets represents an opportunity for BNY to support our clients end to end from servicing to distribution, cash investment, FX hedging, and lending across traditional and alternative asset classes. Last year also saw the mass adoption of digital-asset-exchange-traded products in the US, which grew to more than $100 billion in assets under management.BNY has been an early mover in the digital asset space. Today, we provide fund services for the vast majority of digital-asset-exchange-traded products in both the US and Canada. And over the long term, we believe digital assets and the technology underpinnings have the transformative potential to help solve client and market needs.And finally on this list of important market trends, as global markets evolve and become ever more complex, both buy-side and sell-side firms are looking to outsource certain functions and consolidate providers in order to gain scale and reduce risk. And we expect the strength and connectivity of our platforms to be a differentiator in this regard.As we think about the operating environment in 2025, just a month ago, there were clear signs of optimism with the US election behind us, inflation moderating, and the Fed having begun its path toward lower rates. But with the turn of the year, we view the outlook for 2025 as a little more uncertain, with persistent tail risks across geopolitical tensions and conflicts, uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies, and volatility in markets.Against this backdrop, being positioned conservatively with a strong balance sheet and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on executing our ongoing transformation. While we've made good progress against our strategic priorities over the past 12 months, we have a lot more work ahead of us. As I've said before, strategy is important. Actually doing it and how we do it matters the most.And so on the right-hand side of this page is the reminder of our strategic priorities, and underneath each are some indicators for the progress that we're making. The makeup of our new business wins in 2024, we highlighted some of them on our earnings calls over the past year, validated for us that there is real demand in the market for the type of integrated solutions that BNY can deliver.For example, last year, we've seen a 30% year-on-year increase in sales from clients buying from three or more lines of business. This remains a work in progress but with real runway ahead. Our commercial model enables our client coverage teams to more effectively deliver integrated solutions from across BNY to our clients. And our platforms' operating model realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire organization in furtherance of that commercial opportunity.2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's adoption of the platforms operating model. This transition is not just about driving efficiency. It is also about enabling top-line growth. By simplifying, streamlining, and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys, improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs, and accelerate speed to market.This quarter, we're planning to activate our largest wave of platforms yet so that by the end of March, more than half of our people will be working in the model. We believe that our transition into this model will have a meaningful impact at BNY over the years to come, and so we've included in the appendix of this presentation a summary of the program and the timeline for implementation.Next, our investments in digitization and AI over the last couple of years have laid a solid foundation for us to become more efficient and to drive top-line growth over time. We're embracing the power of AI to make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and channel their energy towards new innovations.To summarize this broader alpha and beta theme, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends while we remain focused on generating alpha through the continued transformation of the company. I'll wrap up on page 6 by reminding you of the value proposition that we laid out for our clients, our shareholders, and our people at the beginning of last year. Our strategic priorities and financial goals are clear, and we remain focused on consistent execution.Before I turn the call over to Dermot for our financial update and outlook, I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world. I'm proud of what our people have accomplished over the past two years and grateful for everyone's continued dedication to the hard work that's ahead of us.And with that, over to you, Dermot.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thank you, Robin. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on page 9 of the presentation and will first touch upon 2024 highlights before diving into the results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $18.6 billion was up 5% year over year. Fee revenue was up 6%. Investment services fees grew 7%, reflecting net new business, higher market values, and client activity across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 3%, driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Despite a year of relatively muted volatility, foreign exchange revenue was up 9% on the back of higher client volumes. Net interest income was down 1%, reflecting changes in the deposit mix, partially offset by higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.Expenses of $12.7 billion were down 4% year over year on a reported basis, largely reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and revenue related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings.On a reported basis, pre-tax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 23% for the year. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 33% and return on tangible common equity was 24%. We reported earnings per share of $5.80. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $6.03, up 19% year over year. And we returned 102% of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2024.Now turning to page 11 for the financial highlights for the fourth quarter, total revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year over year. Fee revenue is up 9%. This includes 9% growth in investment services fees, reflecting net new business, higher client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were also up 9%, driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows.Firm-wide AUCA of $52.1 trillion were up 9% year over year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Assets under management of $2 trillion were up 3% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 24%, driven by higher client volumes. Investment and other revenue was $140 million in the quarter.As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $144 million reduction in investment and other revenue related to a fair value adjustment of a receivable. Excluding notable items, the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the absence of strategic equity investment gains recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.Net interest income increased by 8% year over year, primarily reflecting higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.4 billion were down 16% year over year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.Excluding notable items, which were primarily severance and higher litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2024, expenses were up 2%. This reflects higher revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and increased investments partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $20 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure.Pre-tax margin was 30% and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 34% and return on tangible common equity was 26%. We reported earnings per share of $1.54; and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.72, up 33% year over year.Turning to capital and liquidity on page 12, our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.7%. Tier 1 capital decreased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Average assets were up 1%.Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.2%. CET1 capital decreased by 5% sequentially, and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the fourth quarter. Moving to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115% and the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%.Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on page 13. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 8% year over year and up 14% quarter over quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 1% sequentially.Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 7% in the quarter, and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 1%. Average interest-earning assets were flat quarter over quarter. Our cash and reverse repo, loan and investment securities portfolio balances all remained flat. Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year over year.In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, primarily reflecting higher market values, client activity, and net new business. We're pleased with the broad-based momentum in asset servicing. Clients are increasingly looking to leverage the scale of BNY's platforms and utilize the differentiated breadth of our capabilities. And at the same time, we continue to see particular strength in ETF and alternative servicing, validating the multi-year investments we've made into these platforms.ETF AUCA of $2.8 trillion were up over 60% year over year, with inflows into ETFs on our platform once again outpacing the market, and alternatives AUCA were up 20% year over year. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 4%. Healthy net new business and higher client activity in corporate trust was partially offset by lower depository receipt fees, reflecting a higher level of corporate actions and cross-border activity in the prior-year quarter.Over the course of 2024, we've maintained our market-leading share in straight stats servicing, and by increasing our market share in CLO servicing, further strengthened our number-two position. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 25% year over year, reflecting growth from higher client activity.Net interest income for the segment was up 7% year over year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were up 1% year over year, reflecting higher litigation reserves, employee merit increases, and higher investments partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $643 million, a 39% increase year over year, and pre-tax margin was 28%.Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 15. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 11% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 12% year over year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 9%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. Net new assets were $41 billion, including a large client onboarding in the quarter. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees increased by 13%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and clearance volumes.We continued to see strong US securities clearance volumes on the back of US treasury issuance as well as trading activity across the platform. And we remain focused on increasing market connectivity by expanding our global collateral platform to new markets. In treasury services, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting net new business.In November, the US Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service selected BNY as the new financial agent for the Direct Express program. This decision to appoint BNY speaks to our organization's strength in driving commercial outcomes that broaden access to the financial ecosystem. The program leverages our innovative and resilient payments capabilities to provide disbursement services at scale. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 9% year over year.Segment expenses of $852 million were up 2% year over year, reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, investments, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Pre-tax income was up 28% year over year at $806 million, representing a 48% pre-tax margin.Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 16, Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $873 million, up 29% year over year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 41%. Excluding a notable item in the prior-year quarter, revenue was up 5%, reflecting higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 9%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income partially offset by changes in product mix.Segment expenses of $700 million were up 2% year over year as higher revenue-related expenses and employee merit increases were partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $173 million and pre-tax margin was 20%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 3% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar.In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $15 billion. This includes $27 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $12 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth Management's client assets of $327 billion increased by 5% year over year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows.Page 17 shows the results of the Other Segment. Next, on page 19, our current outlook for 2025. Positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star, and so once again, we have set ourselves up to drive positive operating leverage consistent with our medium-term financial targets.Starting with NII, based on current market implied forward interest rates, we expect full-year 2025 NII to be up mid-single digit percentage points year over year. We expect fee revenue to be up year over year. And we expect approximately 1% to 2% year-over-year growth in expenses, excluding notable items for the full-year 2025.Specific to the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees. And then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the full-year 2025 to be in the 22% to 23% range. And finally, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions remains unchanged. We anticipate to continue to pursue growth opportunities and deliver compelling capital returns to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Based on what we are seeing today, we expect to return 100% plus or minus 2025 earnings over the course of the year. As always, we will calibrate the pace of our buybacks considering factors such as balance sheet growth opportunities as well as macroeconomic and interest rate environments, which are real considerations in 2025.Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5% to 6%. And against the backdrop of continued interest rate volatility, we will continue to manage ourselves to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future.To wrap up on page 20, in January of last year, we shared our firm-wide medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY's pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33% and our return on tangible common equity to equal to or greater than 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have made solid progress towards these targets over the past 12 months and are excited about the year in front of us as our people harness the momentum and continue to embrace our pillars and principles in order to consistently meet or exceed our targets through the cycle.As Robin said at the top of the call, we're pleased with our performance this past year and we're heading into 2025 with good momentum, confident that we're on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. And with that, operator, can you please open the line?
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Hey, good afternoon.
Robin Vince
Hey, Ebrahim.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Yes. Hey, Robin. I guess first question, and it's with the lens of I'm trying to hit your pre-tax margin ROE targets on an adjusted basis this year. I guess I understand it's equal to or greater than. But I'm trying to get a sense of the resiliency of these numbers as we think about, I mean, you've done a great job executing over the last year or two of what the runway is, and is it reasonable for us to assume that those pre-tax margins being higher than where you are today is actually achievable, assuming no big market shock? So maybe if you want to, at a very high level, address that, Robin, and then I can follow up.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Hi, Ibrahim, it's Dermot here. So I would say, as it relates to the medium-term targets that we gave this time last year, and I think you collectively as a group liked those targets that we gave you, and since Robin has taken on the role of CEO, we kind of have eight quarters where we've executed very well, and I'd like to think that we've established a track record of execution and holding ourselves accountable. As Robin said in his prepared remarks, say what you do and do as what you say. And so we feel confident that we're going to hit those targets sustainably through the cycle. So you're going to see more of the same from us and what you've seen in the last couple of years into 2025 and beyond.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Understood. And I guess if I look at slide five and just this whole conversation around 80% of employees being on the platform model by end of 2025. If you could address that in two ways in terms of, does that result in a lot more resilience to your fee revenue growth relative to whatever may happen to markets? One, the resiliency that provides in terms of the synergies you're getting from moving to that model. And again, as that flows through in terms of these targets, Could you actually do much better than where we've been for the last few quarters on the back of the, and maybe that's the 26th event, but I'm just wondering if the platform allows for more resilient fee growth and actually an improvement relative to where we are on margins and ROE?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So the way I think about it is if you kind of look at the three pillars of the strategy, be more for clients, run our company better, empower our culture, And then underneath that, which we talk about less but are very important in terms of how we run the company internally or the pillars and how we show up in terms of behaviors every day, the platform operating model, which we've laid out a page for you, page 22, really is the mechanism by which we kind of drive the three pillars. So I do really believe quite strongly that the platform operating model will drive incremental top-line growth, will make the top-line growth more resilient, but also will allow us to run the company better and become more efficient with that. And that then in turn, we used the words over the last couple of years, de-siloing, bringing our businesses closer together. And that really speaks to, on the top-line side, the launch of the commercial operating model that we kind of went out with in the middle of last year. So you take all those discrete elements together and you add it together, you kind of go, Okay, fee revenue is going to kind of incrementally grind higher from here with the tools that we're deploying and executing.
Robin Vince
And Ibrahim, I'd add one thing to it, which is just this concept that we've talked about before on the call about short, medium, and long term. And we have consistently been investing both for the top line and also for expense efficiency with all three time horizons, and we've been trying to do that pretty consistently over the past two years. And that's relevant for your question because it isn't just a 26 story. It's actually going to be a 27, 28, and 29 story as well, in our opinion, because some of what the platforms model enables is really a foundational point that then allows us to do other things. Retiring systems comes after that. We've retired some, we can retire more. being able to do more solutioning for clients. We've done some, but we can do even more. So it's quite a bedrock thing for us, and given the fact that we won't even be fully into the model until 2026, I think you can expect that there's more payoff to come, 26, 27, 28, through the end of the decade, quite frankly, if we do this well.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Got it, and that's a great slide, the slide 27, so good job. Thank you.
Operator
We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Hi, just two things. One, just to wrap up on that last topic, given that 23, 24, you got to 25% of the folks in the operating model, the platform model, and in 25 you're putting on an incremental 60%, I get that the benefits of all of this is multi-year, but that's a step up in the percentage of employees that are going to be joining the platform in 25. So should we expect that operating leverage will also increase given this large slug of folks coming in in 25?
Robin Vince
I would say the two things aren't a direct correlation in terms of the way that you're linking it, Betsy, because As you go back to the beginning of our platform's operating model, we're already three years into this if you include the very thought at the beginning of the process because we started actually looking at this and thinking about this during my transition into the CEO role. We then designed, we then started to test, we then started to actually execute. And so the deliberateness with which we've gone about this has been very important because We knew that it was a very fundamental change for the company and we wanted to make sure that we were doing it progressively. And although there are some benefits from employee satisfaction and speeding up some of the ways that we work as people go into the model, the real benefits so far we've observed based on the pilots that we actually started doing in 2022 come more like a year or so afterwards as the teams are getting into their new rhythms of working. So there's a phased delivery And then you have the benefit of, okay, now you've got a really tight team operating at a higher velocity, now what can you do with that? Better in control of their design of their systems, better in control of the design of their client products, rationalizing the back end in terms of the multiple, potentially duplicative things. And so we see the lead time associated with it, and I think that the payoffs that you and Ibrahim were sort of scratching at are there, but they're not there as immediately as you're talking about. Now, notwithstanding that, we've got other things, back to my short, medium, and long-term observation, that we have invested in that we feel quite confident will deliver us the expense benefits in 2025 that are part of our guide.
Betsy Graseck
Yes, it just feels like going from 25% to 60% to 80% in one year should, over time, bump up that operating leverage rate. Anyway, that's okay. All right, thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Robin Vince
Thanks, Betsy.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan, your line is now open.
Brennan Hawken
Sorry, had the mute button pressed. Okay, thanks for taking my questions. So we saw a really solid rebound in net new assets at Pershing this quarter. So curious if you could maybe compare and contrast how that would look like for net new assets in prior quarters, X the off-boarding, which we were dealing with. And Robin, I believe you spoke to ultra-high net worth as like a client segment driving or a wealth strata driving some of this. But could you speak to maybe what type of firms are driving this growth? Is it RIAs? Is it broker-dealers? Any particular sources of strength? Thanks.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So thanks for the question, Brennan. Look, 24 was a noisy year given the large off-boarding, and we had, as I said in my prepared remarks, a large onboarding in Q4. And look, I guess the way to think about it is we'd like to reiterate we think we have a good ability and the right to win and grow our net new assets at mid-single digits through the cycle. and that's across the space, whether it's RIAs, whether it's broker-dealers, banks, and we have the team and the technology in place. And if you just look at Wove, this time last year we kind of gave a guide on Wove, we executed the guide on that, we've re-guided hire again this year on Wove, we've now got 36 clients on the platform, we've 41 signed contracts, So all in all, we feel like we have kind of really, really big momentum on purging in the forward. And it's one of the bigger pieces of business that's going into the platform operating model in Q1. So we see to see incremental benefits for that. So purging, it continues to be a very, very strong business for us and we continue to see it growing. And like Robin will touch on the wealth tech sector, but that is one of the fastest growing areas. in the market, and we are a big player in that space.
Robin Vince
Yes, and the thing that I'd add, Brennan, is just you made the point about ultra-high net worth. That's really in our BNY wealth business. We like that business. It's been a solid performer. We think there's more upside in that over time. And then Pershing is really across the high net worth space, and that's got its focus on billion-dollar-plus RIA firms. and that's where we're investing. Together, they're about $3 trillion worth of wealth assets. And so when we think about what is the market trend, we think the US wealth market's a big trend and we're actually approaching it through both of those businesses, one ultra-high net worth, one real software and service approaching the broader retail market.
Brennan Hawken
Great. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. And then shifting gears a bit on the NII expectations, certainly Outlook looks better this year than it did a year ago. Could you maybe help us understand what you would think the trajectory would look like? Do you still think you're largely very neutral? Should that cadence be largely stable? and you made a reference to changes in the deposit mix. Are there any notable shifts in deposit mix that you're assuming as you model out the year?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Okay, so in order to answer the question, Brennan, I'd like to maybe spend a couple of seconds just reflecting on 24 where we kind of gave the guide down 10%, we came in down 1% When I think back on that year, for me it was really kind of broken into three years in one. When we sat here at this time last year, I think the market implied forward curve was pricing in about six to seven rate cuts. And then clearly the Fed was kind of signaling higher for longer in the spring. And that's the way we were kind of positioned at the time. And then clarity over the summer, you had Jackson Hole kind of around the time of the Fed pivot. and we kind of were very proactive on the asset side of the balance sheet there in terms of repositioning the book in terms of taking advantage of the higher rates at the time before the Fed started the easing cycle which we've kind of factored into our guide for this year. And then as we went into the fall and kind of we had a very strong finish to the end of the year and that was really kind of the strength of the franchise, clients doing more with us which led to higher balances overall, particularly NIBs particularly in the corporate trust space where we had more clients doing kind of year-end activity. Now, on balances overall, we've kind of seen that moderate a little bit at the beginning of the year, as you would expect, particularly on the NIB side. And so as you know, the whole NII is made up of balances, it's made up of the forward curve, it's made up of clients doing stuff with us, and it's made up of what we're doing on the asset side. And I've said this many times on prior calls, like, I really do believe that we have a unique strength in terms of the tripod, in terms of the interaction between our CIO, the GLS leadership, and then our treasurer. And that team is working really, really well to deliver the strength of the franchise, which shows up in that strong guide of mid-single digits for this year.
Brennan Hawken
Thanks for that color.
Operator
We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo
I'm torn on this financial services platform company transformation. On the one hand, I guess it's great if everyone's on the same platform. You can have the one BNY. On the other hand, it just seems like a lot of work to go from 25% employees to 80%. Looks like you're ripping the guts out of the company. Maybe you have to run parallel systems. Maybe you have training. When you add it all together in the short term, are you guiding for positive fee operating leverage in 2025? When you're going through a transformation like this, it's tough to show any positive operating leverage, so I get that. And then what are you really playing for in the end? I mean, I get one BNY, I get one platform. It's just a little too conceptual. Could you just put a little more meat on the bones?
Robin Vince
Absolutely, Mike. Happy to. So to make this a little clearer, let me just take you back for a moment to something that we talked about two years ago on the call when we were describing the work that we had done to really underwrite who BNY was, what we do, who does it, how we do it. And we came to this point of view that the essence of the company is that we really provide technology, services, and software for clients to build their businesses on. We have these market-leading platforms, number one in collateral, number one in securities lending, number one in issuer services. Yes, we're the world's number one custodian as well. We've got this big 3 trillion wealth platform that we just talked about. These things are essentially a combination of technology and software and services, and so Allowing our clients to be able to build business, rent the scale of that platform is the very heart of our growth. You can see it in the numbers because Market and Wealth Services, where we've got a lot of those platforms, not all of them, is the part of the company that is the most profitable, with the highest margin, and it's the fastest growing. With that said, recognizing who we are, we had to do two things around how we approach it. We had to get serious and organized around the commercial front end of that. That one BNY, the new commercial model, the stats that we gave you in the presentation around how we're driving to do more things for those clients. We're doing more solutions as well as adding new products. But the other thing that we had to do is you just can't run a siloed backend organization with multiple versions of everything. And I'm not just talking about systems platforms. I'm talking about the very organization of the people. We had, we've joked about this before, we had eight call centers. We had multiple custody pieces of technology. We onboarded clients in every individual bit of the company separately. That just doesn't work for the nature of the company that we are and where we're headed. So we determined that we had to operate and organize differently. That's what Platforms Operating Model is about. But to Betsy's question, We've been very deliberate about organizing it over a multiple time frame. We don't want to create disruption. We don't think we are. We don't think we've had any setback in terms of who we are in grinding through the year because of this. We actually think at the margin it's been a tailwind each year. It can just be an even bigger tailwind in the out years. And with three key metrics in mind. One, employee satisfaction has gone up. as people have been in the model and operated in it. The second thing is we've delivered better for clients and the velocity of that new delivery has gone up. And then the third thing is the efficiency with which we're operating those groups has also improved. So you're right, it's a big change. This is not something you drift into. It's not something you do if you've got a kind of quick clean-up mentality for a couple of years. But if you're trying to make BNY the very best that it can be with a medium to long-range mindset, this is the sort of fundamental thing you do. The good news is we've also been delivering all along the way, and that's important.
Mike Mayo
And do you have an example outside the banking industry software as a service? I mean, when I hang out with my tech colleagues, they'll use phrases like you're using. Is there any example or maybe another bank somewhere else around the world or a fintech or... This is something brand new.
Robin Vince
This is borrowed, broadly speaking, from the technology industry. I've sat down with CEOs of large tech titan companies, and this is essentially how they've built or reorganized themselves. As you say, if you sit down with a CEO of a technology firm, it might be a large fintech firm. It might be a pure tech firm. This is how they've organized themselves. And we're not doing it because it's tech and trendy. We're doing it because the nature of what we do is more platforms-like. Now there are examples in the bank space of some banks who've sort of for little bits of their business have gone after this. There are also examples in the broader fintech space, plenty of examples of firms who've adopted this concept because of who they are. But we think it's a particularly good fit for us. I wouldn't encourage every other bank, I think if you're a and investment bank or a big trading house or a big retail bank. This doesn't necessarily fit, but we're different than that. We are a bank, we have bank form, but the nature of our businesses is quite different and we think quite well-suited to it. And importantly, the early pilots that we've done, remember, we're into this thing already and we've got a lot of measurement of how it's been going and that's what gives us our confidence. It's not just theory.
Mike Mayo
And then last follow-up, tech spending, 24 compared to 25, and do you feel better, worse, the same about your AI efforts?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So like the zip code of tech spending, Mike, we're in the kind of $3.8 billion range of numbers, and we have roughly earmarked a half a billion dollars for investment this year. I feel like really, really good about where we are on the AI journey. We spent the last couple of years building out the infrastructure. We've got really good relationships with the West Coast and we have a seat at the table and learning what to do and how to do it. So I think you're going to hear a lot more from us in the coming quarters about how we deploy AI to run the company better.
Robin Vince
And as a broader statement, this concept of running the company better has different seasons to it. Season number one has been a lot of blocking and tackling. Season number two is really the platform's operating model, implementation, and then harvesting the benefit. That lasts a few years. And then AI. And we think AI is very important. And so within the mix of that 3.8 that Dermot mentioned, there's a gradual pivot that's occurring under the hood around uplifting basic capabilities and infrastructure, which was the past, through to making our systems better through AI. And I think that evolution is quite important. So it may feel like a static number, but it's actually not a static composition. Got it.
Mike Mayo
All right, thank you.
Operator
For our next question, we'll move to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Another one for you guys on operating leverage. So obviously great progress so far. Hear you loud and clear on 2025 and more importantly beyond. I guess in that context, how important is fee operating leverage to the firm? I know you talk about total, which is right, and NII is a helper in 2025. But for whatever reason, if the fee outlook falls short, how much wiggle room do you guys have against that 1% to 2%? And again, maybe talk about the fee operating leverage as well as a metric that you care about or not.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thanks Alex. So we do talk about total and we're very focused on delivering that consistently through the cycle. I also think about it in terms of fee operating leverage and we're also focused on delivering positive fee operating leverage as well. But look, as I said in my prepared remarks, total operating leverage is the North Star. There are a number of factors that go into that. NII, fees, expenses. and with each of those categories we have multiple levers that we can toggle so we feel like we have flexibility over the inputs in terms of how we end up with that number and so I kind of think if you kind of take last year 288 was a very good year and look there was a reasonable amount of kind of positive contribution to that from NII and so we expect to deliver positive fee operation leverage through the cycle as well as well as total.
Alex Blostein
Got it. All right. Super helpful. And then a small, nuanced follow-up for you guys just around NII. We've seen stronger results in the repo business for a handful of quarters now, and I think there's still some expectation for that to normalize, but clearly that hasn't happened yet. So maybe talk a little bit about the factors that contributed to the stronger performance in that part of the model within the quarter, but also maybe within the year. What could change that, given where you are in the environment and the outlook? And what do you think is the appropriate run rate, I guess, for that contribution to NII going forward? Thanks.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So for Cleared Repo, look, strong performance in Q4. The only context I will give you on that, Alex, is it's roughly 5% of the overall NII. So while we talk about it, it's still kind of small in the context of the bigger number. We've invested a lot in it in the last couple of years in terms of technology, better products, being more for clients, et cetera. So on balance, expected to grow, but it's not a meaningful part of the overall number.
Alex Blostein
Okay, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Great. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just on a couple of assumptions on the financial outlook for 2025, maybe just to start with net interest revenue. I appreciate all the commentary you made, Dermot, on the factors on that. It looks like it's more based on the asset and deposit side on mix as opposed to growth in deposits and growth in earning assets. to get your sense of to what extent do you think you can actually grow the deposit base via all the client initiatives you have?
Dermot Mcdonogh
For 24, I think we outperformed on the balance side, but as we look out into 25 and you talk about If you reflect on Robin's remarks in terms of starting the year, a little bit more uncertainty in kind of post the election. So for now we kind of, in the way we've come up with the guide, we expect balances to be roughly flat and the mix shift underneath kind of from Q4 to Q1, I expect NIBs to moderate a little bit and kind of touch down. We're kind of in the zip code of kind of $44 to $46 billion of NIBs is kind of what is embedded in the outlook. But we still have a reasonable amount of the book to roll off at kind of 2% yielding assets into current market rates. So you're correct, David, in terms of like a lot of proactive management of the balance sheet on the asset side has given us confidence around that mid-single digit guide.
Brian Bedell
Okay, great. And then shifting to the fee side, it looks like this guidance is sort of an alpha guide. You talk about the drivers of being higher organic growth as you make progress on the platform strategy, of course, partially mitigated by current currency headwinds. But does this assume generally flat markets? I guess that would be in line with your uncertainty commentary. And then I guess if we do have very strong equity markets, say, if we're up just 10%, what would be the rough delta to revenue on that?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thanks, Brian. So what I would say is roughly kind of 5% on markets from here is about kind of 70 million in fees. That's the rough sensitivity. And to kind of the first part of your question, we've kind of, given the last couple of years, have as you say, really strong performance in markets. We're kind of more neutral on kind of market growth in terms of our guide.
Brian Bedell
Okay, okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Market appreciation, yes.
Brian Bedell
Market appreciation, yes. Okay, yes, thank you.

We'll take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.
David Smith
Hi, good afternoon. You mentioned all of your Hi, you managed to hold your AUCA flat despite a big decline in fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. Can you remind us just how much of that $52.1 trillion might be showing off as a lag and not reflect the full decline in markets we saw later in the quarter? Either way, it seems like inflows to the asset servicing business were really strong in the quarter. Could you comment on the competitive environment that you're seeing there as well, please?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So look, I'll start with The competitive environment, I think very pleased with where asset servicing is in terms of competitive strength, in terms of new business won over the last year. We came into 24 with strong momentum and we executed very well and we talked about a number of the deals that we won on prior calls. We've invested in the infrastructure. I think we're showing up well for clients. and we exit the year feeling very good about the business and I think in some ways asset servicing, everybody looks at asset servicing as the bellwether of the firm and so we kind of enter into 2025 with continued momentum and our right to win and winning our share and the world's largest custodian, I think we're going to do just fine in 2025. There's not a ton of lag.
David Smith
Okay. And then just to clarify, you mentioned 44 to 46 billion of NIBs embedded in the outlook. Is that the average for the first quarter or for the full year?
Dermot Mcdonogh
For the full year.
David Smith
All right. Thank you.
Operator
As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press Star 1 on your telephone keypad now. We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Thomas Leddy
Hi, good afternoon. This is Thomas Leddy standing in for Gerard. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks we all see in the news, what are the primary risks you guys are monitoring for your businesses?
Robin Vince
Well, there are a lot of risks in the world at the moment. I've been asked this question a bunch of times over the course of the past few months, and as you can imagine, we've got wars in essentially two different continents. We've got uncertainty in terms of policy in many countries. We've got some countries' important major economies that have really been struggling to be able to find growth. We've just gone through the great year of elections, and so we've got a lot of new teams in place in countries around the world. There's clearly, at some point, the risk of a downturn or recession in the US It's not something that we see around the corner right now. There's the impact of higher rates. If we lock in rates at higher levels, maybe even 10 years at 5%, five and a quarter, who knows, certainly possible, those things can create complexity as well. So the market's really contending with a long list of things which today are probably each fairly low probability, but there are a lot of them. So the chances of something happening are probably out there. So we're not in the predictions business. We're just trying to prepare. I think our platforms give us the ability to help clients navigate these uncertainties, and so that's clearly our focus. But if you had to pick a couple, you're going to say geopolitical risk probably curve risk, absolute levels of issuance, which is true for several different countries, and cyber risk. Now, on the flip side of that, and I think it's important to mention it, we're a capital markets-oriented company. We're a financial services platform company. And so we're pro-growth. We benefit from growth. And it's very encouraging, including particularly here in the US with the new incoming administration, to hear this pro-growth mantra, because growth is A, important for our business, and B, it enables so many other things. And so on the flip side of the risks, I think there is this undertone of this sort of sense of possibility of the year, which we certainly haven't lost sight of all the while we're managing for the risks that are out there.
Thomas Leddy
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And sort of sticking to the theme of many cross-currents, Can you give us some color on how increased trading volatility attributed to the dynamic interest rate environment might impact your servicing fee revenue growth?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Well, definitely, if you just look at last year, if you just pick one business in particular, clearance and collateral management, which really benefits from increased treasury issuance, increased volatility, clients doing more activity and we just process much more volume on the platform and when you hear us talking about increased volume we mean talking about increased fees and last year there were a number of times where we had records and records on records in terms of what's going through the pipes so I think treasury issuance has been a real tailwind for us over the last couple of years.
Robin Vince
There are two things that I'd add just quickly on composition of revenues because to the prior question, the absolute levels of assets does matter in some parts of our business. To your question, transaction volumes matter. Elsewhere, we have revenues from direct software sales. That's a growing part of who we are and part of this sort of platforms concept. But if you just take something like fixed income, And this goes to the gearing to capital markets that we laid out in one of our trends pages in the presentation. Take fixed income. What's happening in public markets, private markets, in credit, touches so many of our businesses, our clearance business, our collateral management business, our asset servicing business, our corporate trust business, our debt capital markets business, our investment management fixed income business, our investment management LDI business, our cash strategies. The firm across the breadth of who we are is really able to capitalize in a lot of different ways back to this point on growth and activity.
Thomas Leddy
Thank you. That's helpful. And thank you guys for taking my question.
Robin Vince
Thank you.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just wanted to circle back on WOVE. I think, Dermot, you mentioned, and maybe I missed this, you said you had a revenue guide. I saw the $75 million of exit and exit rate annualized in 24. Did I miss the actual guide for 25, or is that the off-boarding point? And maybe if you could just talk about the general progress at WOVE.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So incremental revenue for 25 of 60 to 70, and I would say we're very pleased. 36 clients on the platform, 41 kind of signed contracts. In the prepared remarks, we kind of talked about the proliferation of products that we announced at Insight last summer, so becoming more sophisticated and clients really liking what they're seeing.
Brian Bedell
Got it. And then 67 is incremental to the 30 of 24, is that right?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Yes, that's correct.
Brian Bedell
Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.8% on Wednesday, Jan. 15, as several financial firms reported solid results and a downtick in core inflation revived rate-cut hopes.
Tesla stock surged after reports of strong demand in China for its updated Model Y and upbeat analyst commentary on its AI and robotaxi initiatives.
Strong earnings results helped shares of several banks move higher, including Bank of New York Mellon, which reported growing fee revenues and declining non-interest costs.

Major U.S. equities indexes notched strong gains in the midweek trading session after several banks released upbeat earnings reports. Data from the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also helped underpin the rally, as indications of acooldown in ""core"" inflationin December reinvigorated optimism that the Federal Reserve might implement additional interest-rate cuts in 2025.
The S&P 500 surged 1.8% on Wednesday. Outperformance among several financial sector components helped drive the Dow 1.7% higher, while the recalibrated rate-cut outlook buoyed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which jumped 2.5%.
Tesla (TSLA) shares drove 8% higher, logging the strongest performance in the S&P 500, following reports of a strong first day of orders in China for the carmaker's updated Model Y electric vehicle (EV). The refreshed sport utility vehicle (SUV) is expected to become available in U.S. and European markets within several months. In addition, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted that Tesla stock could reach as high as $800 per share in the coming year.
Bank of New York Mellon (BK) was among the financial firms thatposted positive results, with gains in fee revenue and declines in non-interest expenses helping the bank top quarterly profit estimates. Although BNY's CEO highlighted uncertainties related to the incoming presidential administration's tariff proposals and the unclear prognosis for interest rates, he stressed the bank's positive momentum heading into 2025. Bank of New York Mellon shares also gained 8%, leading bank stocks to rise higher on Wednesday.
While bank earnings dominated the financial headlines, another strong performance came from shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which added 7.7% after the medical technology firm released preliminary fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth of 25% exceeded consensus forecasts, and procedures performed using the company's da Vinci surgical platform jumped 18% from a year ago. Increases in procedures help Intuitive drive higher sales of its single-use instruments and accessories, but the company expects growth in worldwide procedures to decelerate slightly in 2025.
Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell 3.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock initially moved higher on Monday after the maker of yoga attire and other apparel lifted its quarterly sales and profit guidance, highlighting a strong performance during the holiday season. Since then, however, Lululemon shares have experienced volatility and have been unable to hold onto those gains.
Shares of generic drug manufacturer Viatris (VTRS) sank 2.8% on Wednesday. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the import of 11 generic drugs produced at a Viatris plant in India, citing infractions related to manufacturing, handling, and quality control at the facility. Wednesday's drop marked a continuation of a downtrend for the stock since the FDA announced the restrictions.
Hershey (HSY) shares slipped 2.3% on the day. Immediately after the markets closed last week, the chocolate maker announced that CEO Michelle Buck plans to depart from the company. The uncertainty surrounding the leadership team came shortly after a key Hershey shareholder rejected a buyout bid from snack food giant Mondelez (MDLZ) that would have created the world's largest confectionary company.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.

Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0640581007,BK,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Note: Financial Health Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating stronger financial health.
With these tech giants holding significant weight in major indices, their results will undoubtedly influence broader market trends.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.

Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.

Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0640581007,BK,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0640581007,BK,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0640581007,BK,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

However, the bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter tally of 77 cents.Better-than-expected results were driven by lower expenses and benefit from provisions, partly offset by a slight fall in revenues. Notably, assets under management (AUM) reflected weakness during the quarter.After considering M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $825 million or 75 cents per share compared with $830 million or 73 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) EPS BNRI & Surprise Percent - Last 5 Quarters | FindTheCompanyLower Revenues Offset by Fall in CostsTotal revenue (non-GAAP) declined 2% year over year to $3.77 billion. Also, the figure came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.79 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $780 million, down 2% year over year.

This reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories, distribution and servicing expense and net occupancy cost.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2016, AUM was $1.66 trillion, down 2% year over year.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0640581007,BK,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

US0640581007,BK,The shadow of Trump looms over a cautious Fed,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-shadow-of-trump-looms-over-a-cautious-fed-090041612.html,Today 04:00AM,Finviz.com,"The Federal Reserve will gather this week for its first meeting of 2025 under the looming shadow of a new US president who is alreadyposing challengesto the central bank with his words and possible actions.
Trump hinted at acoming clashwith Fed policymakers as he spoke virtually before the World Economic Forum last week, saying he would ""demand"" lower interest rates.
Trump doubled down on his comments later while talking to reporters, noting that he wants rates to come down ""a lot"" and that he thinks the Fed will listen to him. He said he expects to talk directly with Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""at the right time.""
Where Trump and Powellcould be at oddsis that Fed officials have sent multiple signals in the opposite direction, hinting that rates may not be changing for awhile after being lowered by a full percentage point at the end of 2024.
And investors are betting rates won't change at the Fed's policy meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, DC.
What Fed officials repeatedly have made clear in the run up to this meeting is that they are increasinglyconcernedabout signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025.
Some alsohave aired concernsbehind closed doors that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide even more upward price pressure.
In fact, Fed officials recentlylowered their forecasts for additional rate cutsin 2025 from four to two, due in part to their concerns about inflation and the economic effects of Trump's agenda.
Some watchers of the US economy are now raising the possibility that the Fed could even be forced to raise rates this year — a move that would surely invite Trump’s wrath.
Harvard economist Ken Rogoff told Yahoo Finance he doesn’t think the Fed will fire off the two cuts predicted.
""I think the odds of a hike are the same as the odds of a cut,"" he said, pointing to the potential for higher deficits and investments in AI driving the economy.
BNY CEORobin Vincetold Yahoo Finance he also thinks rate hikes are possible, but it's more likely the Fed will hold rates steady for awhile. If the Trump administration unveils new tariffs on China and the European Union, that opens more extreme possibilities.
""I think rate hikes are possible. Anything is possible. You've got to be prepared. Being resilient really matters,"" BNY (BK) CEORobin Vincetold Yahoo Finance at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland.
But hiking rates ""doesn't feel like the most likely outcome. To me, the Federal Reserve has been on a path that looks like they can pause for a little while and take stock of where things are.""
Nouriel Roubini, CEO of Roubini Macro Associates and professor emeritus for the Stern School of Business at New York University, said he sees no cuts happening this year but wouldn’t take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.
""The risk is the Fed that told us last year, 4 cuts this year, then in December said only 2 cuts. And now the markets are pricing maybe only 1 cut, there will be zero cuts,” said Roubini.
If core inflation goes higher, he added, a rate hike cannot be ruled out, even though that’s not his baseline. Tariffs, restrictions on immigration and high deficits could add more inflationary pressures.
""This stuff that can increase inflation … literally this year,"" he said.
Fed policymakers have suggested in their recent commentary that they want tomove slowlyin 2025, as they assess the impact of Trump's policies, even thoughsome do still expect rates to eventually fall further.
Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said earlier this month that the Fed's rate cut in December cut was the ""last step"" in the central bank's ""policy recalibration.""
Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid said recently that ""I believe we are near the point where the economy needs neither restriction nor support and that policy should be neutral.""
Schmid added that he is now in favor of adjusting rates ""gradually.""
Trump’s new comments last week suggested that he may not be so patient as he waits for rates to fall further, setting upa possible collision coursebetween Trump and Powell in the weeks or months ahead.
The president's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were not his first on the subject this year, either. At a Jan. 7 press conference, Trump also said ""interest rates are far too high.""
On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump regularly weighed in with criticisms of Powell, offering that the president should ""have a say"" in Fed decisions and that Powell has ""gotten it wrong a lot.""
In 2018 and 2019, Trump lobbed regular critiques at Powell — whom he appointed to the role — as the Fed raised rates and triggered a stock market sell-off that year,at one point likening the Fed chairto ""a golfer who can’t putt.""
After Trump’s win in November, Powell has also staked out seemingly immovable ground, saying there is “no legal authority” for him tobe removed before his term as chair ends in 2026.Trump said last month onNBC's Meet the Pressthat he has no plans to remove Powell before the chair's term is up.
Roubini warned that if the Fed lost its independence it would make inflation worse because he believes inflation expectations would rise and the bond market would send interest rates higher.
Even holding rates steady may result in a clash.
""I think that even no cuts, as opposed to raising rates, puts the Fed on a collision course with this administration because this administration wants easy money to strengthen economic growth,"" Roubini said.

US0640581007,BK,Is Bank of New York Mellon (BK) Among Billionaire Mario Gabellis Top Stock Picks?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-bk-among-095637634.html,Jan-25-25 04:56AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list ofBillionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) stands against other Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks.
Mario Gabelli is a legendary American investor, renowned for his expertise in value investing and his focus on media, telecommunications, and consumer goods. As the founder and CEO ofGAMCO Investors, Gabelli has built a storied career, consistently delivering strong returns for investors while amassing significant wealth. He was born in 1942 in Italy to a family of modest means. His father was a schoolteacher, and the Gabelli family immigrated to the United States when Mario was a child. Settling in the Bronx, Gabelli became fluent in English while excelling academically. He attended Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA.
Gabelli’s early career began at Lyon, Lavey, and Bessemer, where he worked as a financial analyst before moving to Tudor Investment Corporation in the late 1960s. At Tudor, Gabelli developed a deep interest in media and entertainment stocks, recognizing that these sectors were undervalued and ripe for investment. Gabelli’s early years in finance provided him with a solid foundation in analyzing companies, market trends, and financial statements. In 1976, Gabelli founded Gabelli & Company — which would later become Gabelli Asset Management and then GAMCO Investors — with the goal of applying his value investing philosophy to select, often underappreciated companies.

Under Gabelli’s stewardship, the firm has delivered above-market returns, with Gabelli’s flagship Gabelli Equity Fund returning an average annualized return of 13% over several decades. Gabelli is an ardent advocate of value investing, a strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis, buying companies at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and holding them for the long term. One of Gabelli’s most notable achievements was his early recognition of the potential in media companies. He was one of the first investors to spot the potential of CBS, Time Warner, and Viacom, turning those investments into massive successes. Gabelli is particularly well-known for his focus on the telecommunications sectors as well. He has invested in companies like Comcast, Disney, and Liberty Media, often advocating for management changes and strategic restructuring to unlock value.

""To see a government that's really focused on growth and being able to make the economy everything that it can be, because ultimately, as one of America's leading banks, we are focused on helping our customers to be able to grow and thrive. You know, that's what our platforms are all about,"" Vince says.
Asderegulation under Trumpis expected tobenefit the financial sector, Vince says he's ""not that concerned"" about the risks associated with loose regulation. ""We have to be vigilant that that doesn't happen. We need a strong, healthy financial system,"" he says, explaining, "" We've seen how the strong banks have been able to actually help the system over the course of the events ... We've been a force for strength in the economy, and that's actually the role that we should be playing.""
The CEO underlines, ""I'm looking forward. I'm thinking about the innovation. I'm thinking about the investment. I'm thinking about helping to make economies grow and our clients be successful.""

US0640581007,BK,Federal Reserve could hike rates if Trump tariffs unleash inflation: BNY CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-could-hike-rates-if-trump-tariffs-unleash-inflation-bny-ceo-151451559.html,10:14AM,Finviz.com,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — Investors should rule out nothing from the Federal Reserve in 2025 if the newly minted Trump administrationuncorks fresh tariffs on China and the European Union.
""I think rate hikes are possible. Anything is possible. You've got to be prepared. Being resilient really matters,"" BNY CEORobin Vincetold Yahoo Finance at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland.
""It doesn't feel like the most likely outcome. To me, the Federal Reserve has been on a path that looks like they can pause for a little while and take stock of where things are.""

On his first day in office on Monday, Trump wasted no time stoking tariff concerns. He threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and possibly one as high as 100% on China if a deal on TikTok wasn't reached.
Bank stocks have been on apost-election upswingdespite the unknown of tariffs and their economic impact. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (^BKX) is up 8% since Trump's win, while BNY shares have notched a 3% gain.
Investors have a dinner plate to choose from to explain the bullishness, even with macro concerns swirling.
Under the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) put forth a host of high-profile rules and saw yawning supervisory authority. Trump is expected to roll back that authority to free up the banks.
Meanwhile, deal activity is expected to pick up under Trump as regulations ease. That could help fuel the lucrative M&A departments of the big banks while also supporting broader market valuations and trading businesses.
And lastly, banks affected by the so-called Basel III endgame may be less so, paving the way for capital to be deployed for increased dividends and stock buybacks.
""I think the lesson that we've learned over the past 15 years is banks have added a lot of capital. Banks have added liquidity. The regulators have done a terrific job making the system stronger,"" Vince said.
""Let's go out and use it for the very purpose for which banks are created, which is to be able to help grow and help clients and individuals be able to be successful.""
""We also see scope for deregulation under the Trump administration, which should reinvigorate retail trading [benefiting brokers] and scope for private markets access into the retirement channel [benefiting alts],"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said.
""For the first time since the great financial crisis, the regulatory environment for large-cap banks is likely to stabilize and not get incrementally tougher, and our expectation is that the Fed may either sit on Basel endgame or implement a version of Basel endgame that is capital neutral.""
Graseck'stop picksfor financials include Citi (C), Barclays (BCS), and Robinhood (HOOD).
While the optimism has helped push up bank valuations, the sector itself had a bang-up fourth quarter, and CEOs at the major firms voiced optimism on the outlook for sales and profits.
Fourth quarter results for the big bankslike Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), and Citi (C) were powered by bumper sales in investment banking and trading businesses.
BNY put up a solid though less eye-popping showing, as it's a trust bank instead of a traditional investment bank.
Fourth quarter sales and adjusted earnings rose 11% and 33%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
""We rate Bank of New York Mellon overweight relative to trust bank peers due to: 1) outlook for positive operating leverage on overall basis; and 2) more diversified revenue mix with more areas for fee revenue growth. Bank of New York is also attractively valued,"" JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja wrote following BNY's earnings results.

Trump has indicated he plans a10% baseline tariffon all imports to the United States, with more significant targeted tariffs for some, like China. There has been debate about whether Trump willactually instate the significant tariffsor if therhetoric is a negotiation tactic.
""Tariffs are and always have been a tool of trade policy, and the president's made it very clear that he wants them to be used as part of trade policy,"" Vince says.
The CEO notes, ""I think if you put tariffs on top of everyday items that Americans are consuming, that they go to their local store, grocery store, or home goods store and buy, they can be inflationary. But at the same time, tariffs well applied can also make US businesses more competitive.""

US0640581007,BK,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Great Choice,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170013711.html,Jan-20-25 12:00PM,Finviz.com,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look atThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BK that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.
For BK, shares are up 10.43% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry is up 7.92% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.3% compares favorably with the industry's 4.4% performance as well.
Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation have risen 10.76%, and are up 51.33% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 2.93% and 28.08%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to BK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BK is currently averaging 3,069,734 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with BK.
Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BK's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.57 to $6.86 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.
Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation on your short list.

US0640581007,BK,Bank Of New York Mellon's Differentiated Business Mix And NII Growth Signal Upside: Goldman Sachs,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellons-differentiated-business-185634811.html,01:56PM,Finviz.com,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation(NYSE:BK) shares aretrading slightly lower on Thursday.
Yesterday, the company reportedfourth-quarter 2024 results. The finance behemoth reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 (+33% YoY),beating the street view of $1.56.
Here are some analysts’ take on the stock:
Goldman Sachsanalyst Alexander Blostein reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, raising theprice forecast to $96 from $91.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woodsanalyst David Konrad maintained the Outperform rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $96.
Truist Securitiesanalyst David Smith maintained the Buy rating, with a price forecast of $91.
Goldman Sachs:The analyst sees the company’s 2025 and medium-term targets suggest a strong 10%+ EPS growth, not fully reflected in the stock’s 11X 2025 P/E.
Per the analyst, the management team is gaining credibility, which could lead to increased investor confidence and higher valuations.
Blostein writes that key factors supporting the Buy rating include better NII growth, which is 6% higher than consensus due to improved deposit levels, positive fee income growth driven by a differentiated business mix, and continued expense management with 1% – 2% growth expected in 2025.
The analyst sees potential for sustained positive operating leverage and appreciates the growing investor recognition of the fee growth potential. EPS estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 have been raised by the analyst to $7.09, $8.15, and $9.26, from $6.79, $7.81, and $8.79 respectively, reflecting higher growth compared to consensus.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:The analyst raised 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by $0.15 to $6.80 and $0.10 to $7.65, respectively, due to improved deposit behavior and higher NII expectations.
Per Konrad, while deposits are expected to moderate in 2025, the strong results in the second half of 2024 are projected to drive 5% NII growth in 2025.
Despite recent outperformance, the analyst sees a significant upside as the stock is trading in line with peers.
Truist Securities:The outlook for the year is neutral, with fees expected to rise YoY, the analyst writes.
Per Smith, a 5% increase in markets could add ~$70 million in annualized fees.
BNY plans to invest $0.5 billion, double its 2024 investment. The effective tax rate is expected to be 22% – 23%.
The analyst writes, by the first quarter of 2025, over half of the company’s workforce will operate on the platform model, with plans for 85% by year-end.
Price Action:BK shares are trading lower by 0.69% to $81.47 at last check Thursday.

US0640581007,BK,Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bank-york-mellon-corporation-164505451.html,11:45AM,Finviz.com,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 6.78% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.47 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.29% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.42% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.53%.
In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.88 is up 5.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, The Bank of New York Mellon's payout ratio is 34%, which means it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.
Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $6.61 per share, with earnings expected to increase 9.62% from the year ago period.
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.
Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BK is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 15, 2025, and will not be updated.With that, I will turn the call over to Robin.
Robin Vince
Thanks, Marius. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into our results, I want to address the ongoing wildfires affecting parts of Los Angeles. We're heartbroken by the tremendous loss being suffered by the community, where we have several officers. As always, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of our employees and clients located in the effective areas. And we have also committed matching employee donations to eligible nonprofits, providing relief and recovery to those impacted by the fires.Turning now to our quarterly update presentation, 2024 was an exciting year for BNY, and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. Building on the solid foundation that we laid in 2023, we accelerated the pace of our ongoing transformation and closed out 2024 with a strong performance, delivering record net income of $4.3 billion on record revenue of $18.6 billion, and generating a return on tangible common equity of 23% for the year.Aligned to our three strategic pillars, to be more for our clients, to run our company better, and to power our culture, at this time last year, we laid out a set of medium-term financial targets as well as our action plan to drive sustainably higher revenue growth over time. We're executing against these plans and targets every day.As you can see on page 3 of our presentation, we made very tangible progress in terms of delivery in 2024. For our clients, the rollout of our new commercial coverage model was an important milestone. Effectively cross selling and leveraging the breadth of our business platforms is the single most compelling growth opportunity for the company. And so our commercial model is designed to deliver from across the company at an accelerated pace, improve the client experience, and ultimately deepen our relationships. This is the operationalization of One BNY.But our growth is not just about more of the same. Delivering innovative solutions to the market that leverage the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY is another important way for us to be more for our clients and drive top-line growth. This is One BNY version 2.0. Our acquisition of Archer is a good example for BNY becoming an end-to-end solutions provider, in this case, across the entire managed account ecosystem, be it manufacturing in BNY investments, distribution through Pershing, or servicing through Archer.Over the course of 2024, we also developed numerous new client solutions, such as CollateralOne, Alts Bridge, a next-gen ETF servicing platform, and new capabilities on Wove. This new product momentum is an important investment for the years ahead. Continuing the investment theme, over the course of the year, we further increased our investments to drive both revenues and scalability, and we generated approximately $0.5 billion of efficiency savings as we continue to digitize workflows and begin to leverage new technologies, including AI.We also commenced the phased transition to our strategic platforms' operating model in the spring, and over the course of 2024 transitioned approximately 13,000 employees or roughly one-quarter of the company into this new way of working. Zooming out for a moment, the wrapper for much of our work is culture. Powering our culture remains essential to everything else, and we are starting to see the benefits of our people around the world working more closely together.Celebrating our company's 240th anniversary in 2024 with colleagues, clients, and many other stakeholders around the world felt even more special at a moment in which our people could start to see their hard work leaving a positive mark on this iconic institution. Considering the transformation underway at our company, we decided that the time was right last summer to simplify and modernize our brand and logo to improve the market's familiarity of who we are and what we do.The benefits of BNY's improved visibility in the market have also supported our recruiting efforts. Throughout the year, we've been successful in attracting top talent across the firm, from recruiting our largest intern and analyst classes to further rounding out our executive leadership team. And the targeted investments we'd be making in the employee experience across learning, benefits, and facilities are being recognized and valued by our people.Another important aspect of powering our culture is to deliver on our commitments. We've worked hard to say what we do and to do what we say. And so turning to page 4, I'm pleased that in 2024, we once again met or exceeded our financial goals for the year. We are confident that BNY can deliver positive operating leverage across a wide range of scenarios, and so we started 2024 determined to at least break even from an operating leverage perspective.That was an ambitious goal at the time, considering that our revenue outlook at the beginning of the year foresaw an approximately 10% NII headwind to largely offset growth in fee revenue. Therefore, we had to set up to keep expenses, excluding notable items, roughly flat while at the same time self-funding incremental investments in the business.Dermot will discuss the financials in more detail, but in summary, in 2024, we delivered 968 basis points of positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 288 basis points, excluding notable items. We grew fee revenue by 6% year over year, and NII was down 1%, outperforming our outlook from the beginning of the year by approximately 9 percentage points. Despite higher-than-expected revenue, expenses were down 4% year over year on a reported basis and up 1%, excluding notable items.And finally, consistent with our outlook, we returned 102% of 2024 earnings to our shareholders. Taken together, we delivered record financial results in 2024. Significant positive operating leverage resulted in pre-tax margin expansion and improved profitability, and we delivered attractive capital returns to our shareholders, all of which underscored the execution of a reinvigorated BNY.But now, let's look forward on page 5. We are entering 2025 with strong momentum and determination to deliver further value for our clients and shareholders. BNY plays a central role in global capital markets with $52 trillion of AUCA, $14 trillion of debt serviced, $3 trillion of wealth assets, and $5.6 trillion of assets on our collateral management platform. We manage $2 trillion of AUM. And on an average day, we settle over $15 trillion worth of securities and roughly $2.5 trillion worth of payments for clients around the world.This exceptional client franchise and leadership across our diversified financial services platforms positions us well to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends, several of which we describe on the left-hand side of the page. Some of our fastest-growing businesses in 2024, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management, and Corporate Trust, demonstrate our gearing toward economic growth and higher capital markets activity, both public and private.And through Pershing and Wealth, we are a leader in serving one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services, the US wealth market. Within that market, our wealth business is focused on the faster-growing ultra-high net worth space. Our Pershing business, on the other hand, leverages the size and scale of our platforms to power advisors' businesses, helping them navigate an increasingly complex operating environment using the power of our technology.Relevant for both retail and institutional investors, the trend toward private markets represents an opportunity for BNY to support our clients end to end from servicing to distribution, cash investment, FX hedging, and lending across traditional and alternative asset classes. Last year also saw the mass adoption of digital-asset-exchange-traded products in the US, which grew to more than $100 billion in assets under management.BNY has been an early mover in the digital asset space. Today, we provide fund services for the vast majority of digital-asset-exchange-traded products in both the US and Canada. And over the long term, we believe digital assets and the technology underpinnings have the transformative potential to help solve client and market needs.And finally on this list of important market trends, as global markets evolve and become ever more complex, both buy-side and sell-side firms are looking to outsource certain functions and consolidate providers in order to gain scale and reduce risk. And we expect the strength and connectivity of our platforms to be a differentiator in this regard.As we think about the operating environment in 2025, just a month ago, there were clear signs of optimism with the US election behind us, inflation moderating, and the Fed having begun its path toward lower rates. But with the turn of the year, we view the outlook for 2025 as a little more uncertain, with persistent tail risks across geopolitical tensions and conflicts, uncertainty about trade and fiscal policies, and volatility in markets.Against this backdrop, being positioned conservatively with a strong balance sheet and operational resilience allows us to remain focused on executing our ongoing transformation. While we've made good progress against our strategic priorities over the past 12 months, we have a lot more work ahead of us. As I've said before, strategy is important. Actually doing it and how we do it matters the most.And so on the right-hand side of this page is the reminder of our strategic priorities, and underneath each are some indicators for the progress that we're making. The makeup of our new business wins in 2024, we highlighted some of them on our earnings calls over the past year, validated for us that there is real demand in the market for the type of integrated solutions that BNY can deliver.For example, last year, we've seen a 30% year-on-year increase in sales from clients buying from three or more lines of business. This remains a work in progress but with real runway ahead. Our commercial model enables our client coverage teams to more effectively deliver integrated solutions from across BNY to our clients. And our platforms' operating model realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire organization in furtherance of that commercial opportunity.2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's adoption of the platforms operating model. This transition is not just about driving efficiency. It is also about enabling top-line growth. By simplifying, streamlining, and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys, improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs, and accelerate speed to market.This quarter, we're planning to activate our largest wave of platforms yet so that by the end of March, more than half of our people will be working in the model. We believe that our transition into this model will have a meaningful impact at BNY over the years to come, and so we've included in the appendix of this presentation a summary of the program and the timeline for implementation.Next, our investments in digitization and AI over the last couple of years have laid a solid foundation for us to become more efficient and to drive top-line growth over time. We're embracing the power of AI to make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and channel their energy towards new innovations.To summarize this broader alpha and beta theme, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends while we remain focused on generating alpha through the continued transformation of the company. I'll wrap up on page 6 by reminding you of the value proposition that we laid out for our clients, our shareholders, and our people at the beginning of last year. Our strategic priorities and financial goals are clear, and we remain focused on consistent execution.Before I turn the call over to Dermot for our financial update and outlook, I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world. I'm proud of what our people have accomplished over the past two years and grateful for everyone's continued dedication to the hard work that's ahead of us.And with that, over to you, Dermot.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thank you, Robin. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm picking up on page 9 of the presentation and will first touch upon 2024 highlights before diving into the results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue of $18.6 billion was up 5% year over year. Fee revenue was up 6%. Investment services fees grew 7%, reflecting net new business, higher market values, and client activity across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 3%, driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Despite a year of relatively muted volatility, foreign exchange revenue was up 9% on the back of higher client volumes. Net interest income was down 1%, reflecting changes in the deposit mix, partially offset by higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.Expenses of $12.7 billion were down 4% year over year on a reported basis, largely reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the FDIC special assessment. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 1%, reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases, and revenue related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings.On a reported basis, pre-tax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 23% for the year. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 33% and return on tangible common equity was 24%. We reported earnings per share of $5.80. Excluding notable items, earnings per share were $6.03, up 19% year over year. And we returned 102% of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2024.Now turning to page 11 for the financial highlights for the fourth quarter, total revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year over year. Fee revenue is up 9%. This includes 9% growth in investment services fees, reflecting net new business, higher client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were also up 9%, driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows.Firm-wide AUCA of $52.1 trillion were up 9% year over year, reflecting higher market values, client inflows, and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Assets under management of $2 trillion were up 3% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 24%, driven by higher client volumes. Investment and other revenue was $140 million in the quarter.As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $144 million reduction in investment and other revenue related to a fair value adjustment of a receivable. Excluding notable items, the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the absence of strategic equity investment gains recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.Net interest income increased by 8% year over year, primarily reflecting higher investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.4 billion were down 16% year over year on a reported basis, primarily reflecting the FDIC special assessment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.Excluding notable items, which were primarily severance and higher litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2024, expenses were up 2%. This reflects higher revenue-related expenses, employee merit increases, and increased investments partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $20 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure.Pre-tax margin was 30% and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Excluding notable items, pre-tax margin was 34% and return on tangible common equity was 26%. We reported earnings per share of $1.54; and excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.72, up 33% year over year.Turning to capital and liquidity on page 12, our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 5.7%. Tier 1 capital decreased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income and capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by capital generated through earnings. Average assets were up 1%.Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.2%. CET1 capital decreased by 5% sequentially, and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the fourth quarter. Moving to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 115% and the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%.Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on page 13. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 8% year over year and up 14% quarter over quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Average deposit balances increased by 1% sequentially.Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by 7% in the quarter, and interest-bearing deposits decreased by 1%. Average interest-earning assets were flat quarter over quarter. Our cash and reverse repo, loan and investment securities portfolio balances all remained flat. Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 6% year over year.In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, primarily reflecting higher market values, client activity, and net new business. We're pleased with the broad-based momentum in asset servicing. Clients are increasingly looking to leverage the scale of BNY's platforms and utilize the differentiated breadth of our capabilities. And at the same time, we continue to see particular strength in ETF and alternative servicing, validating the multi-year investments we've made into these platforms.ETF AUCA of $2.8 trillion were up over 60% year over year, with inflows into ETFs on our platform once again outpacing the market, and alternatives AUCA were up 20% year over year. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 4%. Healthy net new business and higher client activity in corporate trust was partially offset by lower depository receipt fees, reflecting a higher level of corporate actions and cross-border activity in the prior-year quarter.Over the course of 2024, we've maintained our market-leading share in straight stats servicing, and by increasing our market share in CLO servicing, further strengthened our number-two position. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 25% year over year, reflecting growth from higher client activity.Net interest income for the segment was up 7% year over year. Segment expenses of $1.7 billion were up 1% year over year, reflecting higher litigation reserves, employee merit increases, and higher investments partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $643 million, a 39% increase year over year, and pre-tax margin was 28%.Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 15. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 11% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 12% year over year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 9%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. Net new assets were $41 billion, including a large client onboarding in the quarter. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees increased by 13%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and clearance volumes.We continued to see strong US securities clearance volumes on the back of US treasury issuance as well as trading activity across the platform. And we remain focused on increasing market connectivity by expanding our global collateral platform to new markets. In treasury services, investment services fees were up 15%, primarily reflecting net new business.In November, the US Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service selected BNY as the new financial agent for the Direct Express program. This decision to appoint BNY speaks to our organization's strength in driving commercial outcomes that broaden access to the financial ecosystem. The program leverages our innovative and resilient payments capabilities to provide disbursement services at scale. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 9% year over year.Segment expenses of $852 million were up 2% year over year, reflecting higher revenue-related expenses, investments, and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower litigation reserves. Pre-tax income was up 28% year over year at $806 million, representing a 48% pre-tax margin.Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 16, Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $873 million, up 29% year over year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 41%. Excluding a notable item in the prior-year quarter, revenue was up 5%, reflecting higher market values partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 9%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income partially offset by changes in product mix.Segment expenses of $700 million were up 2% year over year as higher revenue-related expenses and employee merit increases were partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was $173 million and pre-tax margin was 20%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2 trillion increased by 3% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar.In the fourth quarter, we saw net outflows of $15 billion. This includes $27 billion of net outflows from long-term strategies and $12 billion of net inflows into cash. Wealth Management's client assets of $327 billion increased by 5% year over year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows.Page 17 shows the results of the Other Segment. Next, on page 19, our current outlook for 2025. Positive operating leverage continues to be our North Star, and so once again, we have set ourselves up to drive positive operating leverage consistent with our medium-term financial targets.Starting with NII, based on current market implied forward interest rates, we expect full-year 2025 NII to be up mid-single digit percentage points year over year. We expect fee revenue to be up year over year. And we expect approximately 1% to 2% year-over-year growth in expenses, excluding notable items for the full-year 2025.Specific to the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees. And then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the full-year 2025 to be in the 22% to 23% range. And finally, our philosophy for capital deployment and distributions remains unchanged. We anticipate to continue to pursue growth opportunities and deliver compelling capital returns to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Based on what we are seeing today, we expect to return 100% plus or minus 2025 earnings over the course of the year. As always, we will calibrate the pace of our buybacks considering factors such as balance sheet growth opportunities as well as macroeconomic and interest rate environments, which are real considerations in 2025.Our Tier 1 leverage ratio management target remains unchanged at 5.5% to 6%. And against the backdrop of continued interest rate volatility, we will continue to manage ourselves to the upper end of that range for the foreseeable future.To wrap up on page 20, in January of last year, we shared our firm-wide medium-term financial targets, which were to improve BNY's pre-tax margin to equal to or greater than 33% and our return on tangible common equity to equal to or greater than 23% over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have made solid progress towards these targets over the past 12 months and are excited about the year in front of us as our people harness the momentum and continue to embrace our pillars and principles in order to consistently meet or exceed our targets through the cycle.As Robin said at the top of the call, we're pleased with our performance this past year and we're heading into 2025 with good momentum, confident that we're on the right path to unlock the opportunity embedded in our company. And with that, operator, can you please open the line?
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Hey, good afternoon.
Robin Vince
Hey, Ebrahim.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Yes. Hey, Robin. I guess first question, and it's with the lens of I'm trying to hit your pre-tax margin ROE targets on an adjusted basis this year. I guess I understand it's equal to or greater than. But I'm trying to get a sense of the resiliency of these numbers as we think about, I mean, you've done a great job executing over the last year or two of what the runway is, and is it reasonable for us to assume that those pre-tax margins being higher than where you are today is actually achievable, assuming no big market shock? So maybe if you want to, at a very high level, address that, Robin, and then I can follow up.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Hi, Ibrahim, it's Dermot here. So I would say, as it relates to the medium-term targets that we gave this time last year, and I think you collectively as a group liked those targets that we gave you, and since Robin has taken on the role of CEO, we kind of have eight quarters where we've executed very well, and I'd like to think that we've established a track record of execution and holding ourselves accountable. As Robin said in his prepared remarks, say what you do and do as what you say. And so we feel confident that we're going to hit those targets sustainably through the cycle. So you're going to see more of the same from us and what you've seen in the last couple of years into 2025 and beyond.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Understood. And I guess if I look at slide five and just this whole conversation around 80% of employees being on the platform model by end of 2025. If you could address that in two ways in terms of, does that result in a lot more resilience to your fee revenue growth relative to whatever may happen to markets? One, the resiliency that provides in terms of the synergies you're getting from moving to that model. And again, as that flows through in terms of these targets, Could you actually do much better than where we've been for the last few quarters on the back of the, and maybe that's the 26th event, but I'm just wondering if the platform allows for more resilient fee growth and actually an improvement relative to where we are on margins and ROE?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So the way I think about it is if you kind of look at the three pillars of the strategy, be more for clients, run our company better, empower our culture, And then underneath that, which we talk about less but are very important in terms of how we run the company internally or the pillars and how we show up in terms of behaviors every day, the platform operating model, which we've laid out a page for you, page 22, really is the mechanism by which we kind of drive the three pillars. So I do really believe quite strongly that the platform operating model will drive incremental top-line growth, will make the top-line growth more resilient, but also will allow us to run the company better and become more efficient with that. And that then in turn, we used the words over the last couple of years, de-siloing, bringing our businesses closer together. And that really speaks to, on the top-line side, the launch of the commercial operating model that we kind of went out with in the middle of last year. So you take all those discrete elements together and you add it together, you kind of go, Okay, fee revenue is going to kind of incrementally grind higher from here with the tools that we're deploying and executing.
Robin Vince
And Ibrahim, I'd add one thing to it, which is just this concept that we've talked about before on the call about short, medium, and long term. And we have consistently been investing both for the top line and also for expense efficiency with all three time horizons, and we've been trying to do that pretty consistently over the past two years. And that's relevant for your question because it isn't just a 26 story. It's actually going to be a 27, 28, and 29 story as well, in our opinion, because some of what the platforms model enables is really a foundational point that then allows us to do other things. Retiring systems comes after that. We've retired some, we can retire more. being able to do more solutioning for clients. We've done some, but we can do even more. So it's quite a bedrock thing for us, and given the fact that we won't even be fully into the model until 2026, I think you can expect that there's more payoff to come, 26, 27, 28, through the end of the decade, quite frankly, if we do this well.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Got it, and that's a great slide, the slide 27, so good job. Thank you.
Operator
We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Hi, just two things. One, just to wrap up on that last topic, given that 23, 24, you got to 25% of the folks in the operating model, the platform model, and in 25 you're putting on an incremental 60%, I get that the benefits of all of this is multi-year, but that's a step up in the percentage of employees that are going to be joining the platform in 25. So should we expect that operating leverage will also increase given this large slug of folks coming in in 25?
Robin Vince
I would say the two things aren't a direct correlation in terms of the way that you're linking it, Betsy, because As you go back to the beginning of our platform's operating model, we're already three years into this if you include the very thought at the beginning of the process because we started actually looking at this and thinking about this during my transition into the CEO role. We then designed, we then started to test, we then started to actually execute. And so the deliberateness with which we've gone about this has been very important because We knew that it was a very fundamental change for the company and we wanted to make sure that we were doing it progressively. And although there are some benefits from employee satisfaction and speeding up some of the ways that we work as people go into the model, the real benefits so far we've observed based on the pilots that we actually started doing in 2022 come more like a year or so afterwards as the teams are getting into their new rhythms of working. So there's a phased delivery And then you have the benefit of, okay, now you've got a really tight team operating at a higher velocity, now what can you do with that? Better in control of their design of their systems, better in control of the design of their client products, rationalizing the back end in terms of the multiple, potentially duplicative things. And so we see the lead time associated with it, and I think that the payoffs that you and Ibrahim were sort of scratching at are there, but they're not there as immediately as you're talking about. Now, notwithstanding that, we've got other things, back to my short, medium, and long-term observation, that we have invested in that we feel quite confident will deliver us the expense benefits in 2025 that are part of our guide.
Betsy Graseck
Yes, it just feels like going from 25% to 60% to 80% in one year should, over time, bump up that operating leverage rate. Anyway, that's okay. All right, thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Robin Vince
Thanks, Betsy.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan, your line is now open.
Brennan Hawken
Sorry, had the mute button pressed. Okay, thanks for taking my questions. So we saw a really solid rebound in net new assets at Pershing this quarter. So curious if you could maybe compare and contrast how that would look like for net new assets in prior quarters, X the off-boarding, which we were dealing with. And Robin, I believe you spoke to ultra-high net worth as like a client segment driving or a wealth strata driving some of this. But could you speak to maybe what type of firms are driving this growth? Is it RIAs? Is it broker-dealers? Any particular sources of strength? Thanks.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So thanks for the question, Brennan. Look, 24 was a noisy year given the large off-boarding, and we had, as I said in my prepared remarks, a large onboarding in Q4. And look, I guess the way to think about it is we'd like to reiterate we think we have a good ability and the right to win and grow our net new assets at mid-single digits through the cycle. and that's across the space, whether it's RIAs, whether it's broker-dealers, banks, and we have the team and the technology in place. And if you just look at Wove, this time last year we kind of gave a guide on Wove, we executed the guide on that, we've re-guided hire again this year on Wove, we've now got 36 clients on the platform, we've 41 signed contracts, So all in all, we feel like we have kind of really, really big momentum on purging in the forward. And it's one of the bigger pieces of business that's going into the platform operating model in Q1. So we see to see incremental benefits for that. So purging, it continues to be a very, very strong business for us and we continue to see it growing. And like Robin will touch on the wealth tech sector, but that is one of the fastest growing areas. in the market, and we are a big player in that space.
Robin Vince
Yes, and the thing that I'd add, Brennan, is just you made the point about ultra-high net worth. That's really in our BNY wealth business. We like that business. It's been a solid performer. We think there's more upside in that over time. And then Pershing is really across the high net worth space, and that's got its focus on billion-dollar-plus RIA firms. and that's where we're investing. Together, they're about $3 trillion worth of wealth assets. And so when we think about what is the market trend, we think the US wealth market's a big trend and we're actually approaching it through both of those businesses, one ultra-high net worth, one real software and service approaching the broader retail market.
Brennan Hawken
Great. Thanks for that color. That's helpful. And then shifting gears a bit on the NII expectations, certainly Outlook looks better this year than it did a year ago. Could you maybe help us understand what you would think the trajectory would look like? Do you still think you're largely very neutral? Should that cadence be largely stable? and you made a reference to changes in the deposit mix. Are there any notable shifts in deposit mix that you're assuming as you model out the year?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Okay, so in order to answer the question, Brennan, I'd like to maybe spend a couple of seconds just reflecting on 24 where we kind of gave the guide down 10%, we came in down 1% When I think back on that year, for me it was really kind of broken into three years in one. When we sat here at this time last year, I think the market implied forward curve was pricing in about six to seven rate cuts. And then clearly the Fed was kind of signaling higher for longer in the spring. And that's the way we were kind of positioned at the time. And then clarity over the summer, you had Jackson Hole kind of around the time of the Fed pivot. and we kind of were very proactive on the asset side of the balance sheet there in terms of repositioning the book in terms of taking advantage of the higher rates at the time before the Fed started the easing cycle which we've kind of factored into our guide for this year. And then as we went into the fall and kind of we had a very strong finish to the end of the year and that was really kind of the strength of the franchise, clients doing more with us which led to higher balances overall, particularly NIBs particularly in the corporate trust space where we had more clients doing kind of year-end activity. Now, on balances overall, we've kind of seen that moderate a little bit at the beginning of the year, as you would expect, particularly on the NIB side. And so as you know, the whole NII is made up of balances, it's made up of the forward curve, it's made up of clients doing stuff with us, and it's made up of what we're doing on the asset side. And I've said this many times on prior calls, like, I really do believe that we have a unique strength in terms of the tripod, in terms of the interaction between our CIO, the GLS leadership, and then our treasurer. And that team is working really, really well to deliver the strength of the franchise, which shows up in that strong guide of mid-single digits for this year.
Brennan Hawken
Thanks for that color.
Operator
We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo
I'm torn on this financial services platform company transformation. On the one hand, I guess it's great if everyone's on the same platform. You can have the one BNY. On the other hand, it just seems like a lot of work to go from 25% employees to 80%. Looks like you're ripping the guts out of the company. Maybe you have to run parallel systems. Maybe you have training. When you add it all together in the short term, are you guiding for positive fee operating leverage in 2025? When you're going through a transformation like this, it's tough to show any positive operating leverage, so I get that. And then what are you really playing for in the end? I mean, I get one BNY, I get one platform. It's just a little too conceptual. Could you just put a little more meat on the bones?
Robin Vince
Absolutely, Mike. Happy to. So to make this a little clearer, let me just take you back for a moment to something that we talked about two years ago on the call when we were describing the work that we had done to really underwrite who BNY was, what we do, who does it, how we do it. And we came to this point of view that the essence of the company is that we really provide technology, services, and software for clients to build their businesses on. We have these market-leading platforms, number one in collateral, number one in securities lending, number one in issuer services. Yes, we're the world's number one custodian as well. We've got this big 3 trillion wealth platform that we just talked about. These things are essentially a combination of technology and software and services, and so Allowing our clients to be able to build business, rent the scale of that platform is the very heart of our growth. You can see it in the numbers because Market and Wealth Services, where we've got a lot of those platforms, not all of them, is the part of the company that is the most profitable, with the highest margin, and it's the fastest growing. With that said, recognizing who we are, we had to do two things around how we approach it. We had to get serious and organized around the commercial front end of that. That one BNY, the new commercial model, the stats that we gave you in the presentation around how we're driving to do more things for those clients. We're doing more solutions as well as adding new products. But the other thing that we had to do is you just can't run a siloed backend organization with multiple versions of everything. And I'm not just talking about systems platforms. I'm talking about the very organization of the people. We had, we've joked about this before, we had eight call centers. We had multiple custody pieces of technology. We onboarded clients in every individual bit of the company separately. That just doesn't work for the nature of the company that we are and where we're headed. So we determined that we had to operate and organize differently. That's what Platforms Operating Model is about. But to Betsy's question, We've been very deliberate about organizing it over a multiple time frame. We don't want to create disruption. We don't think we are. We don't think we've had any setback in terms of who we are in grinding through the year because of this. We actually think at the margin it's been a tailwind each year. It can just be an even bigger tailwind in the out years. And with three key metrics in mind. One, employee satisfaction has gone up. as people have been in the model and operated in it. The second thing is we've delivered better for clients and the velocity of that new delivery has gone up. And then the third thing is the efficiency with which we're operating those groups has also improved. So you're right, it's a big change. This is not something you drift into. It's not something you do if you've got a kind of quick clean-up mentality for a couple of years. But if you're trying to make BNY the very best that it can be with a medium to long-range mindset, this is the sort of fundamental thing you do. The good news is we've also been delivering all along the way, and that's important.
Mike Mayo
And do you have an example outside the banking industry software as a service? I mean, when I hang out with my tech colleagues, they'll use phrases like you're using. Is there any example or maybe another bank somewhere else around the world or a fintech or... This is something brand new.
Robin Vince
This is borrowed, broadly speaking, from the technology industry. I've sat down with CEOs of large tech titan companies, and this is essentially how they've built or reorganized themselves. As you say, if you sit down with a CEO of a technology firm, it might be a large fintech firm. It might be a pure tech firm. This is how they've organized themselves. And we're not doing it because it's tech and trendy. We're doing it because the nature of what we do is more platforms-like. Now there are examples in the bank space of some banks who've sort of for little bits of their business have gone after this. There are also examples in the broader fintech space, plenty of examples of firms who've adopted this concept because of who they are. But we think it's a particularly good fit for us. I wouldn't encourage every other bank, I think if you're a and investment bank or a big trading house or a big retail bank. This doesn't necessarily fit, but we're different than that. We are a bank, we have bank form, but the nature of our businesses is quite different and we think quite well-suited to it. And importantly, the early pilots that we've done, remember, we're into this thing already and we've got a lot of measurement of how it's been going and that's what gives us our confidence. It's not just theory.
Mike Mayo
And then last follow-up, tech spending, 24 compared to 25, and do you feel better, worse, the same about your AI efforts?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So like the zip code of tech spending, Mike, we're in the kind of $3.8 billion range of numbers, and we have roughly earmarked a half a billion dollars for investment this year. I feel like really, really good about where we are on the AI journey. We spent the last couple of years building out the infrastructure. We've got really good relationships with the West Coast and we have a seat at the table and learning what to do and how to do it. So I think you're going to hear a lot more from us in the coming quarters about how we deploy AI to run the company better.
Robin Vince
And as a broader statement, this concept of running the company better has different seasons to it. Season number one has been a lot of blocking and tackling. Season number two is really the platform's operating model, implementation, and then harvesting the benefit. That lasts a few years. And then AI. And we think AI is very important. And so within the mix of that 3.8 that Dermot mentioned, there's a gradual pivot that's occurring under the hood around uplifting basic capabilities and infrastructure, which was the past, through to making our systems better through AI. And I think that evolution is quite important. So it may feel like a static number, but it's actually not a static composition. Got it.
Mike Mayo
All right, thank you.

For our next question, we'll move to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Another one for you guys on operating leverage. So obviously great progress so far. Hear you loud and clear on 2025 and more importantly beyond. I guess in that context, how important is fee operating leverage to the firm? I know you talk about total, which is right, and NII is a helper in 2025. But for whatever reason, if the fee outlook falls short, how much wiggle room do you guys have against that 1% to 2%? And again, maybe talk about the fee operating leverage as well as a metric that you care about or not.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thanks Alex. So we do talk about total and we're very focused on delivering that consistently through the cycle. I also think about it in terms of fee operating leverage and we're also focused on delivering positive fee operating leverage as well. But look, as I said in my prepared remarks, total operating leverage is the North Star. There are a number of factors that go into that. NII, fees, expenses. and with each of those categories we have multiple levers that we can toggle so we feel like we have flexibility over the inputs in terms of how we end up with that number and so I kind of think if you kind of take last year 288 was a very good year and look there was a reasonable amount of kind of positive contribution to that from NII and so we expect to deliver positive fee operation leverage through the cycle as well as well as total.
Alex Blostein
Got it. All right. Super helpful. And then a small, nuanced follow-up for you guys just around NII. We've seen stronger results in the repo business for a handful of quarters now, and I think there's still some expectation for that to normalize, but clearly that hasn't happened yet. So maybe talk a little bit about the factors that contributed to the stronger performance in that part of the model within the quarter, but also maybe within the year. What could change that, given where you are in the environment and the outlook? And what do you think is the appropriate run rate, I guess, for that contribution to NII going forward? Thanks.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So for Cleared Repo, look, strong performance in Q4. The only context I will give you on that, Alex, is it's roughly 5% of the overall NII. So while we talk about it, it's still kind of small in the context of the bigger number. We've invested a lot in it in the last couple of years in terms of technology, better products, being more for clients, et cetera. So on balance, expected to grow, but it's not a meaningful part of the overall number.
Alex Blostein
Okay, thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Great. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just on a couple of assumptions on the financial outlook for 2025, maybe just to start with net interest revenue. I appreciate all the commentary you made, Dermot, on the factors on that. It looks like it's more based on the asset and deposit side on mix as opposed to growth in deposits and growth in earning assets. to get your sense of to what extent do you think you can actually grow the deposit base via all the client initiatives you have?
Dermot Mcdonogh
For 24, I think we outperformed on the balance side, but as we look out into 25 and you talk about If you reflect on Robin's remarks in terms of starting the year, a little bit more uncertainty in kind of post the election. So for now we kind of, in the way we've come up with the guide, we expect balances to be roughly flat and the mix shift underneath kind of from Q4 to Q1, I expect NIBs to moderate a little bit and kind of touch down. We're kind of in the zip code of kind of $44 to $46 billion of NIBs is kind of what is embedded in the outlook. But we still have a reasonable amount of the book to roll off at kind of 2% yielding assets into current market rates. So you're correct, David, in terms of like a lot of proactive management of the balance sheet on the asset side has given us confidence around that mid-single digit guide.
Brian Bedell
Okay, great. And then shifting to the fee side, it looks like this guidance is sort of an alpha guide. You talk about the drivers of being higher organic growth as you make progress on the platform strategy, of course, partially mitigated by current currency headwinds. But does this assume generally flat markets? I guess that would be in line with your uncertainty commentary. And then I guess if we do have very strong equity markets, say, if we're up just 10%, what would be the rough delta to revenue on that?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thanks, Brian. So what I would say is roughly kind of 5% on markets from here is about kind of 70 million in fees. That's the rough sensitivity. And to kind of the first part of your question, we've kind of, given the last couple of years, have as you say, really strong performance in markets. We're kind of more neutral on kind of market growth in terms of our guide.
Brian Bedell
Okay, okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Market appreciation, yes.
Brian Bedell
Market appreciation, yes. Okay, yes, thank you.

We'll take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.
David Smith
Hi, good afternoon. You mentioned all of your Hi, you managed to hold your AUCA flat despite a big decline in fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. Can you remind us just how much of that $52.1 trillion might be showing off as a lag and not reflect the full decline in markets we saw later in the quarter? Either way, it seems like inflows to the asset servicing business were really strong in the quarter. Could you comment on the competitive environment that you're seeing there as well, please?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So look, I'll start with The competitive environment, I think very pleased with where asset servicing is in terms of competitive strength, in terms of new business won over the last year. We came into 24 with strong momentum and we executed very well and we talked about a number of the deals that we won on prior calls. We've invested in the infrastructure. I think we're showing up well for clients. and we exit the year feeling very good about the business and I think in some ways asset servicing, everybody looks at asset servicing as the bellwether of the firm and so we kind of enter into 2025 with continued momentum and our right to win and winning our share and the world's largest custodian, I think we're going to do just fine in 2025. There's not a ton of lag.
David Smith
Okay. And then just to clarify, you mentioned 44 to 46 billion of NIBs embedded in the outlook. Is that the average for the first quarter or for the full year?
Dermot Mcdonogh
For the full year.
David Smith
All right. Thank you.
Operator
As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press Star 1 on your telephone keypad now. We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Thomas Leddy
Hi, good afternoon. This is Thomas Leddy standing in for Gerard. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks we all see in the news, what are the primary risks you guys are monitoring for your businesses?
Robin Vince
Well, there are a lot of risks in the world at the moment. I've been asked this question a bunch of times over the course of the past few months, and as you can imagine, we've got wars in essentially two different continents. We've got uncertainty in terms of policy in many countries. We've got some countries' important major economies that have really been struggling to be able to find growth. We've just gone through the great year of elections, and so we've got a lot of new teams in place in countries around the world. There's clearly, at some point, the risk of a downturn or recession in the US It's not something that we see around the corner right now. There's the impact of higher rates. If we lock in rates at higher levels, maybe even 10 years at 5%, five and a quarter, who knows, certainly possible, those things can create complexity as well. So the market's really contending with a long list of things which today are probably each fairly low probability, but there are a lot of them. So the chances of something happening are probably out there. So we're not in the predictions business. We're just trying to prepare. I think our platforms give us the ability to help clients navigate these uncertainties, and so that's clearly our focus. But if you had to pick a couple, you're going to say geopolitical risk probably curve risk, absolute levels of issuance, which is true for several different countries, and cyber risk. Now, on the flip side of that, and I think it's important to mention it, we're a capital markets-oriented company. We're a financial services platform company. And so we're pro-growth. We benefit from growth. And it's very encouraging, including particularly here in the US with the new incoming administration, to hear this pro-growth mantra, because growth is A, important for our business, and B, it enables so many other things. And so on the flip side of the risks, I think there is this undertone of this sort of sense of possibility of the year, which we certainly haven't lost sight of all the while we're managing for the risks that are out there.
Thomas Leddy
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And sort of sticking to the theme of many cross-currents, Can you give us some color on how increased trading volatility attributed to the dynamic interest rate environment might impact your servicing fee revenue growth?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Well, definitely, if you just look at last year, if you just pick one business in particular, clearance and collateral management, which really benefits from increased treasury issuance, increased volatility, clients doing more activity and we just process much more volume on the platform and when you hear us talking about increased volume we mean talking about increased fees and last year there were a number of times where we had records and records on records in terms of what's going through the pipes so I think treasury issuance has been a real tailwind for us over the last couple of years.
Robin Vince
There are two things that I'd add just quickly on composition of revenues because to the prior question, the absolute levels of assets does matter in some parts of our business. To your question, transaction volumes matter. Elsewhere, we have revenues from direct software sales. That's a growing part of who we are and part of this sort of platforms concept. But if you just take something like fixed income, And this goes to the gearing to capital markets that we laid out in one of our trends pages in the presentation. Take fixed income. What's happening in public markets, private markets, in credit, touches so many of our businesses, our clearance business, our collateral management business, our asset servicing business, our corporate trust business, our debt capital markets business, our investment management fixed income business, our investment management LDI business, our cash strategies. The firm across the breadth of who we are is really able to capitalize in a lot of different ways back to this point on growth and activity.
Thomas Leddy
Thank you. That's helpful. And thank you guys for taking my question.
Robin Vince
Thank you.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Oh, great. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just wanted to circle back on WOVE. I think, Dermot, you mentioned, and maybe I missed this, you said you had a revenue guide. I saw the $75 million of exit and exit rate annualized in 24. Did I miss the actual guide for 25, or is that the off-boarding point? And maybe if you could just talk about the general progress at WOVE.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So incremental revenue for 25 of 60 to 70, and I would say we're very pleased. 36 clients on the platform, 41 kind of signed contracts. In the prepared remarks, we kind of talked about the proliferation of products that we announced at Insight last summer, so becoming more sophisticated and clients really liking what they're seeing.
Brian Bedell
Got it. And then 67 is incremental to the 30 of 24, is that right?
Dermot Mcdonogh
Yes, that's correct.
Brian Bedell
Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.

Major U.S. equities indexes notched strong gains in the midweek trading session after several banks released upbeat earnings reports. Data from the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report also helped underpin the rally, as indications of acooldown in ""core"" inflationin December reinvigorated optimism that the Federal Reserve might implement additional interest-rate cuts in 2025.
The S&P 500 surged 1.8% on Wednesday. Outperformance among several financial sector components helped drive the Dow 1.7% higher, while the recalibrated rate-cut outlook buoyed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which jumped 2.5%.
Tesla (TSLA) shares drove 8% higher, logging the strongest performance in the S&P 500, following reports of a strong first day of orders in China for the carmaker's updated Model Y electric vehicle (EV). The refreshed sport utility vehicle (SUV) is expected to become available in U.S. and European markets within several months. In addition, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted that Tesla stock could reach as high as $800 per share in the coming year.
Bank of New York Mellon (BK) was among the financial firms thatposted positive results, with gains in fee revenue and declines in non-interest expenses helping the bank top quarterly profit estimates. Although BNY's CEO highlighted uncertainties related to the incoming presidential administration's tariff proposals and the unclear prognosis for interest rates, he stressed the bank's positive momentum heading into 2025. Bank of New York Mellon shares also gained 8%, leading bank stocks to rise higher on Wednesday.
While bank earnings dominated the financial headlines, another strong performance came from shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which added 7.7% after the medical technology firm released preliminary fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth of 25% exceeded consensus forecasts, and procedures performed using the company's da Vinci surgical platform jumped 18% from a year ago. Increases in procedures help Intuitive drive higher sales of its single-use instruments and accessories, but the company expects growth in worldwide procedures to decelerate slightly in 2025.
Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell 3.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Wednesday. The stock initially moved higher on Monday after the maker of yoga attire and other apparel lifted its quarterly sales and profit guidance, highlighting a strong performance during the holiday season. Since then, however, Lululemon shares have experienced volatility and have been unable to hold onto those gains.
Shares of generic drug manufacturer Viatris (VTRS) sank 2.8% on Wednesday. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the import of 11 generic drugs produced at a Viatris plant in India, citing infractions related to manufacturing, handling, and quality control at the facility. Wednesday's drop marked a continuation of a downtrend for the stock since the FDA announced the restrictions.
Hershey (HSY) shares slipped 2.3% on the day. Immediately after the markets closed last week, the chocolate maker announced that CEO Michelle Buck plans to depart from the company. The uncertainty surrounding the leadership team came shortly after a key Hershey shareholder rejected a buyout bid from snack food giant Mondelez (MDLZ) that would have created the world's largest confectionary company.

US0640581007,BK,BNY Mellon Delivers Strong Q4 2024 Earnings Results with Buybacks Boosting EPS,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-delivers-strong-q4-175914070.html,12:59PM,Finviz.com,"Shares of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is going north over 6% after posting its Q4 2024 earnings results.
Revenue for the quarter reached $4.85 billion, an 11.2% year-over-year increase that surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.66 billion. Net income applicable to common shareholders on a GAAP basis rose dramaticallyto $1.13 billion or $1.54 per share, up from $162 million or 21 cents per share in the last year's same quarter.
The earnings per share increased 33.3% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.19 in the same quarter last year. Efficiency plays little role in the rising EPS because the increase is primarily due to share buybacks that reducesthe number of outstanding shares and increases the EPS. In the fourth quarter of 2024, BK repurchased 1.19% of its outstanding shares or equal to 8,630,682 shares.
The bank reported strong growth in assets under custody and/or administration (AUC/A) and assets under management (AUM), driven by a favorable market rally recently.
Higher fee revenues, net interest income, reduction in provisions and non-interest expenses propelled BNY Mellon's strong results and buybacks also help the bank to deliver higher EPS. Together these factors contributed to a quarter of outstanding financial performance for the bank and fortified its leading position in the financial services sector.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-124503029.html,07:45AM,Finviz.com,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of 7.80%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
The Bank of New York Mellon , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $4.85 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.92%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.31 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
The Bank of New York Mellon shares have lost about 1.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -0.7%.
While The Bank of New York Mellon has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for The Bank of New York Mellon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.44 on $4.65 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.61 on $19.1 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, BankUnited, Inc. (BKU), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2024. The results are expected to be released on January 22.
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
BankUnited, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $259.7 million, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.

The November CPI report showed thatgrocery prices jumped the most in nearly two years, leading to an annual inflation rate of 2.7%, an increase from the prior month’s reading.Wholesale inflation also jumped in December, partly due to the bird flu epidemic that forced egg prices higher.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-150009354.html,Jan-08-25 10:00AM,Finviz.com,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 15, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.5%.
Revenues are expected to be $4.63 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.52% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.16%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of +7.80%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
The Bank of New York Mellon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

US0640581007,BK,Will The Bank of New York Mellon (BK) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-bk-beat-171018539.html,Jan-02-25 12:10PM,Finviz.com,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK). This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.
When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.70%, on average, in the last two quarters.
For the most recent quarter, The Bank of New York Mellon was expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, but it reported $1.52 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7.80%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.43 per share, while it actually produced $1.51 per share, a surprise of 5.59%.
Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for The Bank of New York Mellon lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
The Bank of New York Mellon has an Earnings ESP of +2.46% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 15, 2025.
With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

We recently compiled a list of the10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024.
Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains.
The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows.

This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O’Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs.
Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector.

For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 49.01%

US0640581007,BK,BNY CEO identifies megatrends expected to boost banks profits,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-ceo-identifies-megatrends-expected-201214839.html,Dec-11-24 03:12PM,Finviz.com,"Robin Vince, the CEO of TheBank of New York MellonCorporation (BNY) today shared three “megatrends” he says are not only changing the way the bank works, but is helping them make money.
Speaking at theGoldman SachsFinancial Services Conference in New York, Vince addressed a series of topics ranging from the bank’s financial performance to some of the macro finance trends on which he's helping BNY to capitalize.
“What are the megatrends that are going on in the world, and how do we make sure that our businesses are able to participate in and adapt to those mega trends?” Vince asked, rhetorically. “I'll give you some examples.”
The first example Vince gave was the movement from public markets to private markets. In September BNYlaunchedAlts Bridge, a platform that lets investors trade with private equity giants Apollo,Carlyle GroupandKKR, among a dozen others. Earlier this year, the bank published areportshowing that 74.5% of its traditional and alternative asset managers planned to invest in private equity over the next one to two years. “We've been pivoting the franchise associated with that trend,” he said.
Vince’s second example of a megatrend the bank is trying to capitalize on is what he calls the “direct wrapper,” or to put in another way, the medium by which an asset is traded. As technology improves the kinds of assets have evolved from single stocks to mutual funds to exchange traded funds, and most recently to separately managed accounts, similar to mutual funds but where the investor owns the assets directly.
Last month BNY bought managed account firm Archer Holdco for an undisclosed amount. Archer now facilitates $3 trillion for BNY’s Pershing wealth services arm. “We didn't have all the capabilities there, so we've invested,” he said.
Lastly, Vince says the bank is upgrading its operations. In May 2023 BNY appointed Cathinka Wahlstrom as it chief commercial officer. Previously, most BNY businesses had their ownSalesforcesoftware, call centers, did their own KYC, most did their own marketing and some had their own HR, he said.
Wahlstrom cut out the redundancies and standardized workflows to make it easier to find new client opportunities. “When a client knocks on the door for one product, you can show them how actually it complements something else,” said Vince. “And so now you can have two sales.”
Though Vince shared few numbers during the chat, he alluded to some recent concerns from chief financial officer Dermot McDonogh, who recently issued guidance that net income interest could potentially be down next quarter. “That’s probably not the case anymore,” said Vince. “we don't see Nii as a headwind for next year.”
Surprisingly, the megatrends Vince did not mention includeartificial intelligence, or digital assets—which have been on atear.
Last quarter BNY reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year with a net interest income of just over $1 billion. BNY’s stock is up 51% so far this year to $79, beating the S&P Banks Index, which is up 38% this year.

US0640581007,BK,Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Is the Best Bank Stock to Invest in for the Long Term?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bank-york-mellon-corporation-115051761.html,06:50AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list of10 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) stands against other best bank stocks to invest in for the long term.
Following the 2024 US presidential election, the banking industry has generated quite a lot of returns on the stock market. Bank stocks are dependent on interest rates, the lending environment, and the costs they incur. While higher rates mean that banks can increase their spread and boost interest earnings, if the rates remain high for too long, then the demand for capital dries up in the industry which affects the amount of money they can lend.
Additionally, higher rates also mean that for some banks, particularly those geared towards consumers, interest expenses also jump since they have to pay out hefty amounts to account holders. The high interest costs experienced by these banks don’t mean that those focused on investment banking are spared the ire of high rates. Investment banks suffer from reduced market activity during periods of high interest rates since most investors prefer the comfort of deposit accounts and other vehicles to enjoy risk-free interest income.
These principles have been evident on the balance sheets of some of the biggest banks in America during the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hiking cycle. As an example, consider the H1 2024 results ofAmerica’s second-largest bank by asset size. For the six months ending in June 2023, the bank earned $61 billion in interest income. This marked a strong 118% annual growth as the bank basked in the two-decade-high interest rate era in the United States. At the same time, however, the firm’s interest expenses sat at $32.4 billion to mark an even greater 731% annual jump. As a result, while pre-expense interest income grew by triple-digit percentages, after accounting for interest expense, the net interest income marked a 19% growth and was $28.6 billion.
Similarly, higher rates also mean that banks focused on investment markets end up struggling. This has been the case for America’s fifth-largest bank by asset size. While Wall Street in 2023 and 2024 has seen broader indexes driven by investors’ AI euphoria, in 2022, the markets faced one of their worst years in recent history. Back then, the Federal Reserve unleashed back-to-back 75 basis point interest rate hikes, and most stocks that were not geared to withstand the new economic conditions ushered by the high rates stumbled. From the start of 2022 to the market’s bottom in October, the flagship S&P index had lost 24.8% while the broader NASDAQ’s technology focus meant that it lost a heftier 34%.
Naturally, the fifth largest bank in America which derived 61% of its noninterest revenue from market-making and investment banking operations as of H1 2024 didn’t thrive in this environment. During H1 2022, its investment banking income dropped by 44% to $3.9 billion since it was accompanied by an even sharper drop of 49% for the second quarter. For the full year, the bank recorded a 95% drop in its 2021 ‘Other principal transaction’ revenue of $11.6 billion. This line item included revenue from its “equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in Asset & Wealth Management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments).”
During theQ4 2022 earnings call, management commented on the tough year. CEO David Solomon shared how while his firm was eager to cut costs, it had to ensure that it kept up with competitors in retaining talent. The bank’s stock fell by 6% in early trading following the earnings as investors were spooked by the fact that operating expenses jumped by 11% at a time when revenue fell by 16% and profit dropped by a painful 66%.
Back then, Solomon also shared how high rates and a tight economy had made things difficult for his firm:
“Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter.
While the incoming Trump administration’s perceived business friendliness and its effects on the economy are one reason the S&P’s bank stock index jumped by 12% after the elections, another reason is regulations. Investors believe that the incoming administration will not be as strict with the big banks. Heading into the elections, regulations were at the forefront of the industry’s concerns as we discussed in our coverage of10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Now, banks arehopingthat Basel III Endgame, fair lending rules, heads of regulatory bodies, and private lending are some areas that the new administration might provide them some relief with.
To make our list of the best bank stocks to buy for the long term, we first ranked all US-traded bank stocks by their market capitalization. Out of these, the 40 most valuable stocks in terms of market capitalization were re-ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 45
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the biggest banks in America. It is a Global Systematically Important Bank (GSIB) as dubbed by the US government. This designation means that the bank is somewhat buffered against disruptive events. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is a diversified bank, and it earns revenue through interest and other services. The diversification allows it to benefit from different kinds of economic environments. For instance, during H1 2024, 67% of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)’s revenue came through investment services, performance, and management fees. These sectors typically benefit when interest rates are dropping, indicating that perhaps the reason behind The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)’s 53.7% year-to-date share price gain. On a micro level, the bank’s One BNY strategy through which it aims to consolidate different business functions such as investment management and accounts should drive the hypothesis.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)’s management commented on the One BNY initiative during theQ3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said:
“This program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a One BNY view to account planning, creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients’ objectives and developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals. During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to a platform’s operating model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company. In September, we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well.
Overall, BKranks 10thon our list of best bank stocks to invest in for the long term. While we acknowledge the potential of BK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US0640581007,BK,CFPB Sues Comerica Bank For Allegedly Mishandling Disabled and Older Americans' Accounts,https://www.investopedia.com/comerica-bank-sued-by-cfpb-for-hanging-up-and-charging-junk-fees-to-disabled-and-older-americans-8757417,Dec-06-24 12:54PM,Finviz.com,"Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is suing Comerica Bank for allegedly hanging up on customer service calls, misleading, and charging illegal fees to its 3.4 millionDirect Expresscardholders.
Comerica Bank is a subsidiary of Comerica Inc. (CMA), and since 2008, the U.S. Department of Treasury has contracted with the bank to administer the Direct Express program. This program allows beneficiaries of federal programs like Social Security to receive their monthly benefits payments on prepaid debit cards.
Many Direct Express customers are unbanked and “captive to Comerica,” CFPB said.
“By deliberately disconnecting millions of calls and harvesting illegal junk fees, Comerica boosted its bottom line at the expense of Americans living on a fixed income,” said Rohit Chopra, CFPB director, in a prepared statement.
On Nov. 8, Comerica Bank filed a lawsuit against the CFPB's regulatory overreach and handling of the case, ""which undermined the legitimacy of its own investigation,"" said Louis Mora, Comerica's vice president of media relations, in an email.
""Today, the CFPB doubled down by filing a countersuit against Comerica Bank,"" Mora said. ""We will continue to vigorously defend our record as the financial agent for the Direct Express program and remain committed to serving our cardholders.""
The Department of Treasury announced in November that it will transfer its Direct Express contract to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) starting in January 2025.
The CFPB said Comerica deliberately disconnected more than 24 million customer service calls before they could reach a representative.
Over a million customers were allegedly charged ATM fees when they could legally withdraw government benefits for free. In addition, the bank required thousands of cardholders to close their accounts, which led to additional fees, the CFPB said.
The bank also allegedly misled fraud victims as bank vendors would tell consumers that “no error occurred” even if the bank had determined there was enrollment fraud. The CFPB said Comerica did not properly investigate incorrect or potentially fraudulent charges over 20,000 times.
Comerica had also required their customers to contact and request merchants to stop pre-authorized payment transfers from their accounts when the bank was legally required to stop the transfer itself.
The bureau is asking the court to order Comerica to stop these practices, refund affected customers, and pay penalties into the CFPB’s victim relief fund. Comerica's stock was down 0.8% around midday.

The firm believes there are “potential tangible outcomes” post-election to drive higher earnings, including investment banking, trading, market sensitive revenues such as custody and asset management. Moreover, the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements are likely to continue to be watered down, adds Keefe.

The Treasury Department has named Bank of New York Mellon to take over the lucrative contract previously held by Comerica Bank to operate the Direct Express debit card program serving government beneficiaries.
The decisionhad been expected.
With the contract, BNY gains a free liquidity source of more than $3 billion in deposits a month. The nation's oldest bank has been making apush into faster paymentsand laying the groundwork to expand payments to the underbanked.
The agreement is for five years, beginning Jan. 3, the Treasury said in a press release. Comerica will continue to service existing cardholders until those cardholders register for a new account with BNY.
Comerica said in a separate release that it has agreed to a three-year extension of its services to allow for the orderly transfer to BNY.
The Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service evaluated proposals from several financial institutions and determined that BNY would be able to provide services tailored to Direct Express' users, the Treasury said.
""With the new financial agent, customers will enjoy rent and other bill payment solutions, virtual cards, cardless ATM access, chat and text customer service, online dispute filing, in-person identity authentication options, and more,"" the Treasury said. The program will offer other benefits, such as the ability to sign up for a checking account.
BNY will also provide emergency access to funds as an option, the bank said in a separate press release.
Mastercard will serve as the program's payment network, a role it has played since Direct Express' inception in 2008, BNY said. Additional providers include Mobility Capital Finance, or MoCaFi, a Black-founded fintech platform thatBNY formed an alliance withlast year to provide payments through BNY's Vaia platform. Vaia allows governments and corporate users to send disaster relief, financial aid and employee payroll payments to consumers who are underbanked.
The Direct Express program serves about 3.4 million Americans, most of whom do not have a bank account, the Treasury said. Those enrolled in the program are issued prepaid debit cards to receive their monthly federal benefits.
An estimated 4.2% of U.S. householdswere unbanked in 2023, meaning they did not have a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That's down from 4.5% of households classified as unbanked in 2021.
""Drawing on our leading platform capabilities, we look forward to advancing the program's goal of providing high-quality financial services to individuals and communities throughout the U.S.,"" said Jennifer Barker, global head of treasury services and depositary receipts at BNY.In July, Comerica said it had received preliminary notification that theTreasury would not renewthe bank's Direct Express contract. The $80.2 billion-asset Texas bank first won the contract in 2008, and it was renewed in 2014 and 2020. The contract expires in 2025.
Comerica said in its third-quarter earnings report that it received about $137 million in card fees and had $138 million in direct expenses from the program for the fiscal year to date.
The bank had a tough time operating the program. It faced allegations that it hadshared sensitive consumer datawith vendors andfailed to reimbursegovernment beneficiaries who claimed their benefits had been stolen due to fraud.
Comerica is also being probed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in connection with its administration of Direct Express. The bankhas filed a lawsuitagainst the CFPB, accusing the agency of ""pursuing an aggressive and overreaching investigation.""

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Is Up 1.60% in One Week: What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-170006316.html,Nov-19-24 12:00PM,Finviz.com,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look atThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
In order to see if BK is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up.
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.
For BK, shares are up 1.6% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry is up 1.59% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.65% compares favorably with the industry's 10.18% performance as well.
Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation have increased 17.39% over the past quarter, and have gained 66.91% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.44% and 32.19%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to BK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BK is currently averaging 3,664,242 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with BK.
Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BK's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.63 to $5.82 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.
Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation on your short list.

US0640581007,BK,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Great Choice,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160011620.html,Oct-24-24 12:00PM,Finviz.com,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look atThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
In order to see if BK is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up.
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.
For BK, shares are up 3.4% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry is up 2.65% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.82% compares favorably with the industry's 4.96% performance as well.
While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation have increased 17.37% over the past quarter, and have gained 82.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.71% and 39.26%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to BK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BK is currently averaging 4,390,501 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with BK.
Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BK's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.63 to $5.74 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.
Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that BK is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation on your short list.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK) reported strong third-quarter results with a 22% year-over-year increase in earnings per share, reaching $1.50.
Total revenue increased by 5% year over year to $4.6 billion, driven by broad-based revenue growth across all business segments.
Assets under custody and/or administration surpassed $50 trillion for the first time, highlighting BK's market-leading position.
The company announced the planned acquisition of Archer, which is expected to enhance BK's asset servicing capabilities and expand distribution for its investments business.
BK's liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high of over $1.5 trillion, reflecting strong client cash across various investment alternatives.
Provision for credit losses was $23 million, primarily due to reserve builds related to commercial real estate exposure.
Net new assets in Pershing were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting ongoing deconversion of lost business from the prior year.
Investment management and performance fees saw only a 2% increase, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.
Expenses, excluding notable items, increased by 1% year over year, driven by higher investments in employee merit increases.
The depository receipts business continues to face challenges, with a decline in the number of sponsored programs.
Q: How much of the ETF servicing growth was due to the BlackRock business, and is the revenue from that fully realized?A: Dermot Mcdonogh, CFO, explained that while he couldn't discuss specifics about individual clients, the ETF market is growing, and BNY Mellon is a key player. The revenue from recent ETF growth is not fully realized yet, as onboarding is done in phases, so some revenue is still to come.
Q: Could you discuss the deposit beta experienced with the first rate cut and the potential for deposit growth as rates decline?A: Dermot Mcdonogh noted that the first rate cut was fully passed on, and while it's too early to predict deposit growth due to the Fed's easing cycle, BNY Mellon has maintained strong deposit levels. He expects balances to moderate slightly but sees no significant changes currently.
Q: How much of BNY Mellon's recent success is due to market conditions versus strategic initiatives?A: Robin Vince, CEO, emphasized that while market conditions have been favorable, BNY Mellon's growth is also due to strategic initiatives like the 1BNY approach, which focuses on providing holistic solutions to clients. The company has seen growth across all business segments and is leveraging its platform model to drive further growth.
Q: Can you elaborate on the impact of the commercial lift-off initiative and the enterprise approach on revenue growth?A: Dermot Mcdonogh highlighted that the commercial lift-off initiative, led by Cathinka Wahlstrom, has organized BNY Mellon's client coverage to deliver holistic solutions. This approach is expected to drive revenue growth as clients increasingly buy multiple services from BNY Mellon.
Q: How does BNY Mellon view its capital allocation strategy, particularly regarding M&A and stock buybacks?A: Robin Vince stated that BNY Mellon is opportunistic with M&A, focusing on bolt-on acquisitions like Archer that align with strategic priorities. The company aims to return 100% or more of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, maintaining a strong capital position while investing in growth opportunities.

Robin Vince
Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start with a few remarks on the quarter, and then Dermot will take you through the financials in greater detail.In short, BNY reported strong third quarter results, reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Stepping back on the macro side for a moment. At the beginning of the year, markets have priced in significant monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns.Despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic outlook since then, we've now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world, including a 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates in the US as the Federal Reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance employment, inflation and growth.Following increased market volatility and a sell-off in equities in early August, markets recovered and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher. A little more micro, but relevant for markets.Around the most recent quarter end, the market saw simultaneous flows into the Fed's reverse repo facility, alongside the first meaningful usage of the standing repo facility, both of which we administer. At the same time, sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher repo rates, possibly signaling a transition from abundant to ample reserves in the system, with potential implication for the pace of QT going forward.More broadly, while markets have been constructive, there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead, and so we constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist from geopolitical tensions and conflicts to fiscal deficits and the impact of impending regulations and elections.Now referring to page 2 of the financial highlights presentation. As I said earlier, BNY delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter with strong EPS growth on the back of broad-based revenue growth and positive operating leverage.Reported earnings per share of $1.50 were up 22% year over year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.52 were up 20%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased by 5% year over year, and reported expenses of $3.1 billion were flat.Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 1% year over year as we continue to invest in our people and technology while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better ways.Pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved year over year to 33% and 23%, respectively. For the first time in our history, we reported over $50 trillion of assets under custody and/or administration at the end of the quarter. our custody is not something we are, but it is something important that we do.This number one market position improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company, and it provides opportunity to drive value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of BNY to our clients. We increasingly see that the true power of BNY's client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across our leading Security Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investments and Wealth businesses.We have the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new innovative solutions to the market from across the scenes of these businesses. As an example, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Archer, a leading technology-enabled service provider of managed account solutions to the Asset and Wealth management industry.Archer provides comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the industry, managed accounts, at scale, expanding distribution, streamlining operations, launching new investment products and delivering personalized outcomes for their clients.The integration of Archer should produce a positive impact across several of our lines of business. In addition to augmenting our asset servicing capabilities for managed accounts Archer will provide our Investments business as well as our wealth adviser platform in Pershing with expanded distribution of model portfolios and access to Arch's multi-custodial network.Buy it once, use it many, if you will. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, and we look forward to welcoming the Archer team to BNY.Another one of the fastest-growing areas in financial services alternatives also presents a promising opportunity for us to deliver new client solutions across 1BNY. We already have relationships with hundreds of alternatives managers as well as roughly $3 trillion of wealth assets on our platforms.We believe there is more for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast-growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries, advisers and the investors they serve.Last month, we introduced Alts Bridge, a comprehensive data, software and services solution built for wealth advisers. Alts Bridge aims to make investing in alternatives easier for advisers through a streamlined end-to-end experience and direct integration into advisers' existing desktops, starting with our Pershing NetX360 and Wove platforms.As we continue to deliver new, innovative products, we are also addressing the significant opportunity from enhancing our commercial model, making it easier for clients to navigate BNY. In order to accomplish this, we are promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage, and we are operationalizing our new commercial model.For example, over the summer, and for the first time in recent memory, we brought together several hundred of BNY's client-facing commercial leaders from around the world as well as members of our executive committee for a two-day event we called Commercial Lift Off.This program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a 1BNY view to account planning, creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients' objectives and developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals.During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to a platform's operating model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company.In September, we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well. We now have about 13,000, or about a quarter of our people working in our new operating model.As we've said before, powering our 1BNY culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company better requires not just words, but action. I want to thank our people around the world for their hard work and for collectively pulling together as a team to create the change for our clients, for our shareholders and for one another.To wrap up, the combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together and the strength of our balance sheet gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. While our results in the third quarter demonstrate continued execution against our strategic priorities as well as progress towards our medium-term financial targets, our team remains focused on the work ahead.With that, over to you, Dermot.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 3 of the presentation, I'll begin with our consolidated financial results for the quarter.Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 5% year over year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This includes 5% growth in Investment Services fees, reflecting higher market values and net new business across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Firmwide AUCA of $52.1 trillion were up 14% year over year reflecting higher market values, net new business and client inflows.Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 18% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 14%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $196 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading.The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of last year, and improved results from our seed capital investments. Net interest income increased by 3% year over year, primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix.Expenses of $3.1 billion were flat year over year on a reported basis, and up 1% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investments in employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $23 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve builds related to commercial real estate exposure.As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year over year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.52, up 20% year over year. Pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on tangible common equity was 23%.Turning to capital and liquidity on page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%. Tier 1 capital increased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and improvement in accumulation of other comprehensive income, partially offset by catered for our shareholders through common stock purchases and through dividends.Average assets increased by 1%. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%. The CET1 capital increased by 5%, and risk-weighted assets increased by [1%]. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we returned 103% of earnings through dividends and buybacks.Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 116%, a 1 percentage point increase sequentially due to a favorable change in our deposit composition. And the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%, unchanged sequentially.Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was up [3%] year over year and up 2% quarter over quarter, (inaudible) increase was helped by higher sponsored clear repo activity (inaudible) market volatility and increased client demand.Average deposit balances remained flat sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 2% in the quarter and interest-bearing deposits were flat. Average interest earning assets were up 4% quarter over quarter.Our investment securities portfolio balances as well as loan balances increased by 1%, and cash and reverse repo balances remained flat. Our broader liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high at the end of the quarter of over $1.5 trillion worth of client cash across deposits, money market funds, securities lending, sponsor cleared repo and other short-term investment alternatives.Turning to our business segments, starting on page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 6% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year over year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values.For the third quarter in a row, the impact of repricing was de minimis. ETF AUCA of $2.7 trillion was up more than 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced was up 20% year-on-year. Inflows into ETFs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes.As the ETF industry continues to grow, we are dedicated to scaling our best-in-class ETF service offering. For example, we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution platform to advance digital adoption.In Issuer Services, Investment Services fees were up 1%. Net new business and higher client activity in Corporate Trust was partially offset by lower deposit receipt fees, reflecting corporate actions in the prior year. Against the backdrop of increased issuance activity, we continue to see strength in Corporate Trust, capitalizing on our investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability.In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 28% year over year, reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 2% year over year.Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were down 3% year over year, reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases. Pre-tax income was $642 million, a 38% increase year over year, and pre-tax margin was 29%. And next, markets and wealth services on page 7.Markets and wealth services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year over year. Total Investment Services fees were up 7% year over year. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 1%, reflecting the impact of lost business in the prior year, partially offset by higher market values.Net new assets were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of lost business in the prior year, which is now largely behind us. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 4% annualized net new asset growth in the third quarter.Wove continues to see strong client demand. We signed up 14 additional clients in the third quarter, and we remain on track for the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in 2024 as we guided in January. Wove is helping us attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones.For example, Pershing provides custody and clearing solutions for Sanctuary, a large and fast-growing wealth manager servicing the high net worth and ultra high net worth segments. Sanctuary will also leverage Wove portfolio solutions, trading and rebalancing and reporting for teams that custody with Pershing as well as those that use in other custodian.In Clearance and Collateral Management, Investment Services fees increased by 16%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. Against the backdrop of a growing market and active trading, US securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong.As you may remember, we created our global clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of Pershing institutional solutions. We're pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing, settlement, execution and financing solutions in over 100 markets around the world.In Treasury Services, Investment Services fees were up 11% and primarily reflecting net new business. The business continues to execute well against the growth agenda we presented in January. And we are seeing our investments in modernizing and digitizing our payments platform pay off in the form of growth in our strategic target markets. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 3% year over year.Segment expenses of $834 million were up 5% year over year, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year over year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin.Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $849 million, up 2% year over year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 1%, reflecting higher market values and improved seed capital results, partially offset by lower performance fees and the mix of AUM flows.And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 6% and reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $672 million were flat year over year as efficiency savings offset employee merit increases and higher investments.Pre-tax income was $176 million, up 7% year over year, and pre-tax margin was 21%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion increased by 18% year over year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the third quarter, we saw strength in our short-term strategies with $24 billion of net inflows into cash, reflecting our leading position and strong investment performance in our Dreyfus money market funds.Long-term active strategies saw $8 billion of net outflows spread across multi-asset, LDI and active equity, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income. And we saw $16 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $333 billion increased by 14% year over year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the Other segment.Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on the outlook for the year, starting with net interest income. Remember, we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for full year net interest income to be down 10% in 2024.While we're currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results, the resilience of our net interest income over the first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the full year net interest income growth rate from January by approximately 5 percentage points.Regarding expenses, we continue to work hard to keep core expenses, excluding notable items for the full year 2024 roughly flat. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be at the lower end of the 23% to 24% range we estimated in January.And lastly, as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we remain on track, having returned 103% of earnings year-to-date.In conclusion, our results this past quarter reflects broad-based growth across our three business segments and continued progress on our strategic priorities. We're pleased with the company's performance year-to-date, and we're proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our medium-term financial targets, while we all remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us.With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A.

Brennan Hawken
You flagged some of the ETF wins that you had on the servicing side. So curious about that. Number one, how much of that was the BlackRock business business that you've won? And has the revenue from that when that they win fully turned on?And did those dynamics have something -- or like is the fee rate lower because fees in Asset Servicing were up about 5%, but AUC 16%, and I know sometimes the ETF fee rates are a little lower. So curious to flesh that out a bit.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So thanks for the question. I don't really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction, but just to take a step back on ETFs generally it is a growing market. You may have watched Larry from BlackRock on CNBC this morning.It is a secular trend. It is a very big and growing market, and we are a key player in that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have $2.7 trillion on the platform. That's up 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced is up 20%.That's on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology, so we can be best-in-class. So without going into specifics, we're there to take advantage of the secular trend, and we'll continue to innovate and solve for our clients' needs.
Brennan Hawken
Okay. Maybe if I could word it a little differently. The strong ETF growth that you have seen this quarter, is the revenue fully reflected this quarter? Or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to come?
Dermot Mcdonogh
I would say it's the latter. It's generally speaking, strong pipeline. We're always adding new clients to the platform. And they -- because of the size of what's been onboarded, they tend to do it in a phased approach. So some revenue is on the platform, some revenue to come.
Brennan Hawken
Excellent. Thank you also for the update on NII, encouraging to see things working better. Could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut? And given that we're seeing rates coming down now, is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So the basis, I think we've said on previous calls, we view it as isometric. So for us, the first rate cost was 100% passed on. So we feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of where we are in the Fed easing cycle. I think it's probably a little bit too early to see how that's going to feed into the deposit balance story.I think overall, we've -- we've held in there. We had a strong Q3 for a variety of different reasons. So I would say I expect where we are to moderate a little bit on balances and we'll see what happens next with the next Fed meeting but no significant change for us as we sit here right here today.

(Operator Instructions) Mike Mayo. Wells Fargo.
Mike Mayo
That's a bet the $50 trillion of AUC, a nice round number. you did be factual that you beat expectations for the quarter and the year so far as you highlighted. I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is lucky versus being smart?And I imagine it's a bit of both, but the lucky part is record stock market volatility, trading, some other factors in the market that have gone your way. And I don't feel like we have enough information on your client growth, the underlying client growth, the most repeatable part of the company.So could you give us some color on whether it's growth in clients or maybe it's revenues per client or maybe it's products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about, how you're managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate in?
Robin Vince
Sure, Mike. It's Robin. I understand the question, and it's obviously a very legit question. We broke through the [50]. By the way, we ended at [52]. So the good news is we didn't stop at the round number. I'd say that it isn't just fashionable, it's actually old-fashioned, traditional, just the way that we want to do it in terms of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus.And so we've tried to provide as much visibility as we reasonably can into the inputs of what it is that's ultimately driving this progress because we understand we have benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets. And of course, it's part of our business to be able to be well positioned to take advantage of those backdrops.We've got parts of our business which respond to asset values. We've got parts of our business that respond to the number of accounts. We've got parts of our business that responds to software sales, transaction volumes. And having that multifaceted set of business response functions, if you want to call it, that is actually a deliberate strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets.And so if you believe that overall debt issued in the world, equity valuations in the world, financial market activities are going to grow, we're trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends. We think that's good.Having said that, to the heart of your question, this is the work that we've really done in the early days since this management team took over, which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to understand how they could work together, so how they could hum together in order to be able to unlock more potential.And so we rallied to the firm around three strategic pillars, this thing of being more for our clients. And that's not just words. It's been about (inaudible) coming to us because we can do more than one thing for them. And it's not just that we're selling more things to them.It's that they actually want to take advantage of bundles of things, which actually provide a better solution to their business. And then our second pillar of running the company better, that's been about sales rhythms and sales targets and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is trying to do.And then wrapping the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture, wanting to push forward, wanting to make BNY of the future, more than BNY Mellon was of the past. And those things are all quite deliberate, and we start -- and we believe that we're starting to see the results of that, although it's still early in our results.But Dermot can give you a couple of additional things on this, which I think also would be helpful.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So Mike, the way I -- from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective is we're up 5% year-on-year in fee growth and constructive markets. And so we've been able to take advantage of constructive markets, but a couple of important points that I would draw out is that in all three of our business segments, we've seen solid underlying growth.And in Robin's prepared remarks, he talked about the fact that we're evolving into a platform company. And when we have platforms that we're investing in at scale, so when you have high volume and you have constructive markets, we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that.Asset Servicing, we're winning and onboarding new business. We came into the year with a backlog, we onboarded the business throughout the year, and we're beginning to go into the Q4 with a bigger backlog than we came into at the beginning of the year.So Asset Servicing, I feel very proud of. Corporate Trust depository receipts, Corporate Trust specifically a good margin business, but something that has been devoid of investment over a number of years, and we've put money to work there in terms of leadership and scaling our technology, and that's going to be a business -- an important business for us in the future.And Treasury and Services and Clearance and Collateral Management have really shown what when you have a scale platform with high volume, strong markets, lots of issuance, lots of payments, you take advantage of that.And then on just the client-specific thing, albeit it's a small base and we can -- we've highlighted a couple of transactions this year where we're able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients, and clients are now buying from us across more than one line of business, in some cases, four lines of business.That was something that we just could not do a couple of years ago. And Robin's point about bringing the 1BNY to bear on clients is really beginning to pay dividends.
Mike Mayo
All right. Well, that was very comprehensive. Just last follow-up. Are you implying -- and by the way, on all the metrics, again, the client growth numbers are what -- and thanks for pulling back the layers of the onion there, but always like even more layers, never enough for us, but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going down the line.But the expense is clearly, Dermot, the flat expenses that very clear on that part of it. Are you implying even lower expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So look, the thing I would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we worked really hard over the last couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base, and we guided flat at the beginning of the year.And broadly speaking, there's been some pressure, I would say, on expenses that, for the most part, are revenue related. And so if revenues are higher, there're some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses. So while I've guided roughly flat for the full year, there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because of higher revenues.And also, as Robin said in his remarks, we've announced the acquisition of Archer and there will be some integration costs associated with that. But I feel very good the fact that now we have 53,000 people who understand the importance of financial discipline, and that goes to pillar number two of being a really well-run company.
Operator
Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Maybe just on -- just sticking with the revenue dynamic, the -- talking about the opportunity, the commercial lift off and the enterprise approach. The early traction that you're getting, I think you referenced some clients now doing multiple services, can you talk a little bit more about how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory?And then also just if you can just reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets. I think it was like 10% equity market moves can have a impact of about 1% revenue. So I just wanted to break apart those two dynamics, just really showing that you're actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets.
Dermot Mcdonogh
So if I take the last question first, hopefully, that was your two questions in one go. So a 5% gradual change in equity markets is roughly $60 million in fees annually and a 5% gradual change in fixed income markets is roughly 40% -- or $40 million in fees annually. So that's a little bit on the sensitivity analysis.And so on just the commercial lift off that Robin talked about in his remarks, it really is (inaudible) who's with us now for over a year spent the first year really on a listening tour and organizing roughly our 1,200 to 1,500 leading client coverage people around the world in terms of what we want our ambition to be, what are the products that we have and how can we educate our total force to be able to out there with clients delivering the whole of the firm.I think, and also if you just talk about Archer for a second, I think a couple of years ago, if we were to do that acquisition, one part of the firm would have bought it for its business. And I think Robin's point in his remarks are really, really important where you buy it once, you use it multiple times, and it's an acquisition that's done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business.And that's how you should think about how our client coverage model is going to work in a strategic way going forward. We're going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients. Clients have a better understanding of the diversified nature of our business franchise, and they're just buying more from us.And it's just going to show up in revenue, and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for Q4 and the opportunities that are going to come our way in 2025.
Operator
Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein
So maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee and a bigger picture question. When you guys think about a number of different growth areas you outlined some of the specifics, and obviously, the approach to cross-selling has taken a whole different attorney here.So when you use them out and you look at the business holistically, how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise can generate over time?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So you're trying -- so we don't guide on fees, haven't done -- don't intend to do it here. But what I would say is, and I gave this answer as an earlier question, we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments.Our underlying organic growth this year, we feel quite happy about, and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of the year. And there's no reason to expect that, that momentum won't continue. And I do feel the way we've set up for the back half of this year and into next year, it's a flywheel of innovation, and we have a lot of growth initiatives.And we've come together and we have a group of people who are working on what we call integrated solutions. And so we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline. Robin talked about (inaudible) Bridge in his remarks, talked about Archer in his remarks.There are things that we're doing within specific lines of business coming together. We talked about Pershing being realigned into Clearance and Collateral Management, and that's driving growth as well. So the decisions that we've taken over the last couple of years in terms of realigning certain activities into different parts of the firm are showing up in our revenues this year, and we will continue to do that into next year.
Robin Vince
And Alex, I'd just add, Dermot really alluded to this in what he just said. But right from the beginning, we've had two approaches. One is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing BNY's potential as a multiyear endeavor, and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years.And North Star, as you know, for us, is operating leverage, and that came about in a slightly different way in 2023 than it did in '24, and it could be different again in '25 as we really get into that conversation ultimately when we talk to you in January. But we've simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the shorter term and for the medium term and for the longer term.And so both Dermot and I have talked about this platform's operating model. That's a great example. There have been some benefits that come early on in that process. We brought like things together across the company. There have been benefits on the revenue side.There have been benefits on the expense side from doing it. But then the value of having done it creates medium-term momentum because now we're able to be more dynamic for clients. We're able to solve problems more quickly for clients.And so there's a payoff there. And then over the longer term, it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that Dermot was just talking about. And again, there's a revenue story there, but there's also an expense story.And that's how we're thinking about it. Notwithstanding, we haven't given you a specific growth target number. Make no mistake, we're invested in creating that growth.
Alex Blostein
Yes. No, fair enough. I appreciate all that. Smaller tactical question for you guys. So the repo activity continue to be quite elevated, and you mentioned that in your prepared remarks as well. Is it possible to help size how much repo contributed across the enterprise? It hits you in a couple of different ways.Obviously, there's the NII benefit and there's some fee benefits. So as you think about the more normalized level of reproductivity versus what you saw in the quarter, how big of a contributor was that in totality?And as you look forward, given changes in monetary policy expectations, but also some of the client behavior that you mentioned earlier, how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So on the repo question, so a cleared repo, for sure, we saw elevated activity, particularly going into the back end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter. And that, in large part, contributed to the outperformance for the Q3 NII. That has now moderated somewhat.And so in my prepared remarks, and in terms of the guidance, that's why I feel like roughly for NII, we're about $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In terms of cleared repo, overall, as a contributor to the NII over the course of the year, it's roughly about 5% of the number.As it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity, I think from what we see on our platforms, we see that continuing to be the case in the medium term. There's no reason for the slowdown. It's been a very strong year, very, very active client engagement, product innovation.And particularly on the international side, we said at the beginning of the year in our strategic call in January that international was going to be a key area of focus on the platform, and that's been the case, and that's shown up in the results.So I think overall, as I said in my prepared remarks as well, in terms of the liquidity ecosystem in total hit a high for us at $1.5 trillion. That's up from $1.2 trillion a couple of years ago, and that's in the backdrop of liquidity coming out of the system. So we've grown quite substantially. And that again is coming back to connecting the dots across the firm, getting teams collaborating more, being more digital, providing innovative solutions to clients, and that is really powering the growth.
Robin Vince
If I could just relate that back to a question that Mike had asked earlier on because I think these things are relevant. You got to remember that the strategy of us having roughly the right ores in roughly the right waters to be able to participate in things that are happening in the world, that's very important.So if I just supplement what Dermot said, with the additional observation that we're the world's largest security lender that generates repo activity. We're the world's largest collateral manager so we get to capture fees associated with repo doing repo.We obviously play this role in the US treasury market, which participates in the growth of US Treasury repo. We have all of these different touch points. And so there are different ways in which we can collect across software, in some cases, services that we administer in others, and participation in different, both global markets and also product types, which align in indirect ways to that.So that's an important part of how we look at the overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those, and we can participate in the benefit of that growth.

Robin, can you give us some thoughts with -- obviously, you talked a little bit about the acquisition you accomplished in this quarter. What your outlook is for -- you've obviously very strong capital levels, your stock has moved very nicely this year and you get a better currency.What the outlook is for just other types of acquisitions if there are some that could be complementary to what you're currently doing?
Robin Vince
Sure, Gerard. First of all, just make a quick comment about Archer. Looking forward to closing that transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in. And this relates a little bit to a couple of other things that we've already talked about on the call.One is participation in markets and the other one earlier on, on ETFs. If you just think about the way that we view the world construct, once upon a time they were mutual funds. More recently in the past decade or so, it's really been the explosion of ETFs.And there's simultaneous thing going on, which is the growth of separately managed accounts. And so in the same way that Dermot described how we've participated in outsized participation of the ETF migration, Archer is a transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the transition to separately managed accounts.So it relates to that strategic question, o growth and participating in different markets that we talked about. Now stepping back to the other part of your question, really, the heart of it on M&A, look, our primary focus is what we have and how we can improve on it. And Dermot and I both talk a lot about the fact that we've looked very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses.We think we have a great set of businesses. We think they are great ones to be in, and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other. And we think that the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients in more joined up ways and solutions than maybe we have before.So it isn't that we do M&A from a position in any way of needing to do things, it's we're able to be very opportunistic, and we obviously like that a lot. But notwithstanding that we're pleased with what we have, we don't want to be complacent.So we keep our eyes open, and we look at things and Archer came about as a result of a strategic business review that we did internally, looking at long-term trends, looking at how we might adapt to those trends. And then we went out and we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that, with the key emphasis being on the word capability, digestible bolt-on things that accelerate what we're trying to do or derisk delivery of what we're trying to do.And if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves with a great team, great technology, ideally like this one, an installed book of business is also helpful, then we feel very good about it. As long as it aligns with those priorities, is a good cultural fit, has a good attractive returns. So that's our M&A thought process.And then that fits into the overall waterfall, which we've talked about before, which is, if we have excess capital, we're going to, of course, be prudent. And so we like excess capital. That's bad thing in an uncertain world. And so that's a very important consideration.Then we look at whether or not we could invest it. Good news, as you know, we're a pretty capital-light model, we're very capital generative, so we don't need a ton of capital to reinvest in our business to keep growing it.Then we look at whether or not we need something -- for some type of additional need, like the Archer example and then we distribute the rest. And this has been obviously a good year to see all of that on display. We've been prudent.We've run at elevated capital levels, and, as Dermot indicated, we intend to return 100%-plus of net earnings to shareholders, and we've been able to make an acquisition. And so this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the world.
Gerard Cassidy
Very good. And then just a quick follow-up, Dermot. You gave us that sensitivity analysis about a gradual 5% change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on revenue. Was that for up markets, meaning if the gradual increase was 5% up, does that also reflect down market, if markets were down 5%, that's the impact we would expect to see?
Dermot Mcdonogh
That's correct, Gerard, that's correct.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America.
Ebrahim Poonawala
I have a follow-up with some of your responses. I think, I guess, depending how -- maybe starting with this capital allocation. So how do your response to Gerard's question around M&A and such. But just talk to us how you think about, means when we think about the valuation of the stock on price to earnings, price to tangible book, at the same time, this year has been pretty good market backdrop wise, and as an investor shareholder, you care about ROE resiliency of these firms.So one maybe, Robin or Dermot, talk to us about your comfort around ROE resiliency? If the market backdrop is unfavorable, what's the flex in the system? And given where things stand today, like how do you think about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100%-plus buybacks and dividends?
Robin Vince
I'll take the second bit first, and then Dermot will reflect on the first part of your question. So the good news is that we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock. And we appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction.We believe in ourselves as well. And so what we do, of course, consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return framework, we don't view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks.
Dermot Mcdonogh
Ebrahim, when I took on the role a couple of years ago, I guess I got a lot of questions about is this just going to be more of the same or what's different? And now we're several quarters into the new team, and Robin has really bolstered that team and through the strategic pillars, communication, the principles, the medium-term financial targets has really started to evolve the culture of BNY.And so it is our commitment to deliver to our shareholders' positive operating leverage through the cycle. And so if you just take a step back and look at this quarter's financials, 5% revenue growth, flat expense growth, 33% pre-tax margin, upper end of Tier 1 leverage 6%, 23% return on tangible common equity and a 22% EPS growth.And what I would say is a solid beast. So I don't really think about the valuation of the firm on any given day. We just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders. And if we do that in a first-class way, the valuation will take care of itself.
Robin Vince
And you asked about the returns and our comfort with them. Look, we've given medium-term targets, as Dermot just said, that's greater than or equal to 23% for ROTCE. And so we obviously appreciate touching that, but doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets.And in terms of the resiliency, remember the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification. We talked about the equity markets and the fixed income markets. I talked about the fact that it is software, its services, platforms and market valuations and transaction volumes.These are all that we participate in. Capital markets activities has been important to us in 2024. The fact that we participate through our Corporate Trust business through our debt capital markets business, those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally.We participate in scale of markets and things like the treasury market is a good example. And so this diversification of our mix helps us to be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle.Now of course, things will move around, and that's why Dermot mentioned the point about our our commitment to positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine because we recognize that NII, which is part of our mix, but so too are the fees and then our ability to control expenses.We could make expenses less than they are now. We've chosen to manage them at the level that they are because we believe that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the environment, but it wouldn't always have to be so.
Ebrahim Poonawala
Appreciate that. And if I can sneak one quick more follow-up. Dermot, I think you mentioned fourth quarter NII slightly lower than 3Q. We've seen a few rate cuts in Europe, in the US now in September.Is it fair to assume that absent a dramatic change in rates, this $1 billion in quarterly NII is where we are bouncing around at the bottom? And then if deposit growth picks up, QT stops, that it should go off that base? Or am I missing something?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So if you look back at our last five quarters, we've toggled between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Q3 was a stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons, principally volatility in the market at the beginning of August and clients held more cash.And then towards the back end of the quarter, once there was a clear view on where the Fed was going to go at rates, clients started to put money into money market funds, which ended up with us. And so we benefited from those two principal things. And so our deposit balances have leveled off here.We expect maybe NIBs grind down a little bit from here. And so as I said maybe 10 minutes ago, $1 billion for Q4 is the best guidance I can give you today. And for '25, I don't see NII being a a headwind for us. And we've taken extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our CIO book to insulate '25.

Two quick questions. One is on the buyback question, and I know you said, look, you're very accretive on earnings accretion. You don't need a lot of capital for the business model, of course, as we know, and you're above your target CET1 of 11% and Tier 1 leverage target 5.5% to 6%, you're at the high end of that range.And so when we think about the 100%-plus, how should we think about the plus part of the 100%-plus? Because it feels like totally 100% makes sense, but there's room to bring these to optimize the capital structure more. So I'm thinking about -- I'm wondering what time frame are we talking about to optimize your capital structure, do you feel?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So thanks for the question, Betsy. Last year, we returned a little north of 120%. This year, in January, we guided a 100% or more. Given the uncertainty in the markets, geopolitical, the US presidential elections, a wide range of uncertainty with Fed.In January, we thought the year was going to be very different to where it's ended up. And I think, on previous calls, we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is the 6% range.And so when you take that and the Archer transaction, we think we're still on track to do the 100% or more [through] three quarters, we're at 103%. So I wouldn't expect that to materially change from here.
Betsy Graseck
Okay. Got it. And then the other question is you mentioned a third of BNY is now on the platform model. And are you taking 100% of the firm there? And just wondering about implications for the runway for efficiency improvements as you execute on that?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So a quarter of the firm, roughly 13,000 employees are on the platform now, happened in two waves, March and September, with another wave going live in Q1 of next year. And so I wouldn't necessarily think about platform operating model as a mechanism just for efficiency. It really is -- it's going to drive top line growth and is going to run the company better and it's going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joined-up thinking.So it really is the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars. And so the answer to the question about 100% is, yes. And from probably -- from here, it's probably another 18 months before the firm is fully up there. But by the end of Q1 of next year, we expect about half of the firm will be live on the model. And the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive. So it's really worked well for us as a firm.
Robin Vince
And Beth, you remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18-month point because sometimes it's not until folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that they're really able to examine some of the core questions that, that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize. So we expect the benefit that that Dermot was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18-month point.
Operator
Glenn Schorr, Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr
Just one wrap up for me. Dermot, I love you pointed out the 5% revenue growth, flattish expenses lead to 20% earnings growth. That is the power of the BK model. If you look just -- I know it's just one quarter, but if you look at the sequential numbers, the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little bit.I'm just -- all I'm asking is, does that inform us in any way of how we're looking at as we roll into '25? A lot of your business metrics and balance and client wins are up. So my gut is now, but I just want to see from that perspective, how you feel about that?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So I think you got it correct. It is (inaudible). And it's all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized. So it's just in terms of the backlog across all our businesses, strong pipeline continues to grow. And, yes, so your intuition is correct.
Operator
Rajiv Bhatia, Morningstar.
Rajiv Bhatia
Yes. Just a quick one for me. I guess, on the depository receipts business, and I appreciate it's a small business, but the number of sponsored programs continue to decline. Is that something we should continue to expect to decline? And is it competitive takeaways or something else that's driving that?
Dermot Mcdonogh
So I wouldn't really read too much into that. That's -- we've talked about that for several years about the sponsored program going away and not been around. It's still here. Deposit receipts is a small business in the totality of it, but it is a very, very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients, and it has got a very good margin to it.And we have like very significant market share in that business. So it's something that we continue to invest in. We think it's very important for our franchise, and we don't see a secular decline in that business from where we see it today.
Robin Vince
We also off-boarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business. So the headline of total number is a little bit misleading actually when -- if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline, you'd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small.

Just one more on the margins. You mostly at your 33% target in most areas. So you generate more sales from moving to the platform model, and as we move into, say, next year or beyond, I guess, what's the view on spending some of that and investing in the business versus actually generating, potentially generating margins well above [33%]?
Dermot Mcdonogh
SP1 So my answer to that one, Jim, would be, we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver 33% margins through the cycle. We gave guidance for the first time in January, and then we just managed to get there pretty quickly.But we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time. We're heading into a very -- what's going to be quite an interesting budget season for us because we've done a lot of great things this year. I know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year.And to offset that balance, we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. And so the next eight weeks and how we set up the firm for next year would inform how we communicate with you in January. But we set out those targets because we believe we could hit them. The positive is we got there earlier than we thought. And now we want to show that we can improve and maintain those margins that we've guided to previously.
Robin Vince
Brian, the best clue I could give you in terms of how we think about that, it's a little bit more detail is if you actually look at us on a segment-by-segment basis, you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage journey differently in our three segments. And we told you a year or so ago that, that's what we were going to do.And so maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment, if you look at Market and Wealth Services, we aren't trying to grow the margin there. We're very happy with the margin, we just wanted to grow the total size of the business, which is exactly what we've been doing.There are the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our medium-term targets for those segments. There, we are really growing the margin. And so you can see exactly your question at work in our segments.

With all this talk of the transitioning of the employees, I guess, half the employees to the new platform over the next one to two years, how much do you see AI playing a role? And can you give any metrics? I mean keeping expenses flat. I don't know how much you're still investing in AI.When Emily presented at the Boston Bank Conference last November, it seemed like BNY was all in for AI. It was one of the most bullish cases made yet you've heard out in the the broader world, sometimes you have hit, sometimes you have misses.So where -- how does AI relate to the whole platform strategy? And how committed are you to AI? And do you have any numbers that you can give us, some concrete metrics?
Robin Vince
Sure. So just to reiterate, we've got a quarter of our people in the platform's operating model. And as Dermot said, it's an 18-month trajectory from here. That's really, Mike, the way I think about platform's operating model is this concept of, if you take it that we are, in fact, more and more a platforms company in terms of these large at-scale capabilities often software and services that we deliver generally in market-leading positions, number one, in a variety of different markets.We've talked about things -- the businesses before, I won't repeat them, then it follows to us from that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a platform's operating model, which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operate themselves.And so that is a strategy around how we organize ourselves in pursuing being pursuant to our broader strategy. Now AI as a -- which is, of course, part of that, have an AI hub. We have a couple of hundred people in that AI hub, and we are absolutely investing in AI and do believe in the power of AI to be able to help our business in terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and efficient.And we haven't made a lot of noise about it, but don't misunderstand that for a lack of interest or investment because we haven't slowed down. In fact, we've increased our AI investment. And of course, notwithstanding all of that, you can see that from running the company well on an expense line, we're not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management.And this is where I don't mean to be pity, but it's very, very important learning for us is that we, as a company, can walk and chew gum at the same time. can invest in things that matter and we can manage the company well. We make choices and AI is a choice of something we're leaning into, and we think that's important for the future.

Ellison notes that, fundamentally, bank earnings aligned with investor expectations. However, he emphasizes a significant shift: ""The mathematics of the business is working in their favor for the first time in a while,"" as banks grow equity, buy back stocks, and see tangible book values increase. Furthermore, he points out that as banks like JPMorgan see their balance sheets expand, ""the banks are becoming a much bigger part of how the Fed is going to fund the government,"" which creates additional value for these major financial institutions.
""Those are the things that I see: the Fed is shrinking, the banks are getting bigger, and because of that, they're becoming more important and more profitable,"" Ellison tells Yahoo Finance.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-154512465.html,11:45AM,Finviz.com,"Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.
Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 43.04% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.47 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.53% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.48% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.51%.
In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.88 is up 19% from last year. Over the last 5 years, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.92%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon's current payout ratio is 31%. This means it paid out 31% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.
BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.67 per share, with earnings expected to increase 12.28% from the year ago period.
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.
For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BK is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

The finance behemoth reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 (+20% YoY),beating the street view of $1.42.
Quarterly revenue of $4.648 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, surpassed the analyst consensus of $4.542 billion.
Net interest income rose by 3% YoY, driven mainly by higher yields from the investment securities portfolio and balance sheet expansion, though partially offset by shifts in the deposit mix.
Fee revenue in the quarter grew 5% year over year to $3.404 billion. Investment revenue rose, reflecting a strategic equity loss in 3Q23 and better seed capital investment performance.
Noninterest expense for the quarter stood at $3.1 billion flat YoY, as higher investments and merit increases were offset by efficiency savings and a reduced FDIC assessment. Excluding notable items, it increased 1%.
The Bank of New York Mellon reported average deposits of $285 billion, which increased 9% year over year and remained flat sequentially.

As of September-end, CET1 capital was $19.7 billion, and Tier 1 capital was $24.0 billion, up from June-end, due to earnings, partially offset by stock repurchases and dividends.
Dividend: BNY declared a common stock dividend of $0.47 per share, payable on November 1 to shareholders of recordas of the close of business on October 21.
The bank returned $1.08 billion to common shareholders, including $353 million in dividends and $725 million in share repurchases, achieving a total payout ratio of 103% year-to-date.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-114502478.html,07:45AM,Finviz.com,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of 5.59%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
The Bank of New York Mellon , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $4.65 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.37 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
The Bank of New York Mellon shares have added about 43% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.
While The Bank of New York Mellon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for The Bank of New York Mellon: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.49 on $4.6 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.67 on $18.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Bank of America (BAC), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2024. The results are expected to be released on October 15.
This nation's second-largest bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
Bank of America's revenues are expected to be $25.29 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.

US0640581007,BK,BNY becomes first bank in history with $50 trillion in assets under custody and administration on the way to a record quarter,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-becomes-first-bank-history-103500635.html,06:35AM,Finviz.com,"It took BNY 240 years to pass $50 trillion in assets under custody and administration, reaching 52.1 trillion as of September 30, according to it’s quarterly report out today, and by doing so became the first bank to cross the milestone. Boston-basedState Streetis in second as of last quarter with $44.3 trillion under custody and administration, and is unlikely to pass the milestone on Tuesday when its next quarterly report comes out.
But of course, it’s the ability to monetize those assets that matters most. The New York-based bank also reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year, generated a record $3.4 billion in fees, up from $3.2 billion in Q3 of lastyear, and had a net income of $1.1 billion, a 16% increase over last year.
The bank’s stock is up a whopping 76% over the past year, reaching $74 as of the time of publication. It’s been a gangbuster’s year for the banking sector generally speaking, which dampens the impressive growth. But it’s still far outpacing the average growth of 48% seen by other American banks according to theDowJones U.S. Bank Index.
“The combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together, and the strength of our balance sheet, gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable, long-term shareholder value,"" said CEO Robin Vince in a statement provided toFortune.
Contributing to that growth, BNY yesterdayannouncedit would custody Washington D.C.-based Wisdom Tree’s $80 billion worth of U.S. listed ETFs, including one of the first U.S. bitcoin ETFs. The development follows on news last month that BNY had received an exception from the SEC allowing it to account for the crypto assets it custody’s on a separate balance sheet. Essentially, the highly volatile assets are being custodied in such a way that they aren't seen as a risk to the rest the bank.
In August Fortune exclusivelyreportedthat BNY's proprietary artificial intelligence was already being used by 14,000 of its 55,000 employees.
It’s not been all good news for BNY though. In August BNY Mellon Securities Corporation and Pershing LLC,agreedto pay a $40 million penalty for record keeping failures, and last week the bank was caught up in a Moscow arbitration court proceeding that saw hundreds of millions of dollars in assets frozen pending further review.
Analysts at Equisights andWells FargoSecurities both have BNY stock listed as a hold, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Despite the record quarter one Morningstar analyst marked BNY as an under performer, with a target price of $63.00.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Is Up 0.39% in One Week: What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-160007948.html,12:00PM,Finviz.com,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look atThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BK that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.
For BK, shares are up 0.39% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry is up 0.39% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.97% compares favorably with the industry's 2.78% performance as well.
While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation have increased 10.24% over the past quarter, and have gained 72.76% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 2.69% and 33.98%, respectively.
Investors should also take note of BK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, BK is averaging 4,119,082 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with BK.
Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BK's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.61 to $5.66 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.
Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation on your short list.

US0640581007,BK,Stay Ahead of the Game With The Bank of New York Mellon (BK) Q3 Earnings: Wall Street's Insights on Key Metrics,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stay-ahead-game-bank-york-131507008.html,09:15AM,Finviz.com,"The upcoming report from The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share, indicating an increase of 10.2% compared to the year-ago period.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 0.8% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.
Prior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.
While investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.
Bearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific The Bank of New York Mellon metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.
Analysts expect 'Revenue- Market and Wealth Services- Total revenue' to come in at $1.47 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%.

According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Market and Wealth Services- Net interest income' should come in at $396.44 million. The estimate indicates a change of -1.4% from the prior-year quarter.
Analysts forecast 'Total interest-earning assets - Average balance' to reach $343.39 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $339.04 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.
The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Tier 1 Leverage Ratio' will likely reach 6.0%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 6.1%.
The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Tier 1 Capital Ratio (Standardized Approach)' of 13.9%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 15.2% in the same quarter last year.
The consensus estimate for 'Total Capital Ratio (Standardized Approach)' stands at 14.6%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 16.2%.

US0640581007,BK,The banks best positioned to benefit from easing rates: Expert,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/banks-best-positioned-benefit-easing-205856612.html,Oct-07-24 04:58PM,Finviz.com,"JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BNY Mellon (BK) will kick off the third quarter earnings season on Friday.
Citizens JMP director of financial technology research Devin Ryan joins Market Domination to break down what investors can expect from these earnings and his top plays in the sector.
After the Federal Reserve delivered a 50-basis-point cut in September, Ryan explains, ""What you earn on your cash on the asset side of the equation is going to come down a little bit. But the flip side is the deposit costs are going to come down as well."" Thus, he points to names like Charles Schwab (SCHW) that are in a position to benefit after underperforming in the last year.
""Even though on one hand, they are going to see a little bit of a lower asset yield on some of their short-term stuff, the longer-term securities are rolling off and they're going to reprice higher,"" Ryan tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, ""And then they have this funding cost dynamic where customer, essentially cash deposits, have been going out the door to money markets. And I think that's going to stop as well.""
In addition, Ryan notes that capital markets have been ""very depressed."" As interest rates continue to fall, companies will likely decrease their financing, and in turn, financials could see a rise in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity.
He also points to Goldman Sachs (GS) as another great opportunity, as he is bullish on its alternative asset management business. ""The alternative asset managers trade at 25 times or more on forward earnings. So as that part of their business becomes more meaningful, that's going to move the needle,"" Ryan argues.
Ryan highlights Perella Weinberg (PWP) as a small-cap play in the sector. He explains, ""It's a small advisory boutique trading at 13 times our estimate for next year. The peers are over 20 times. So I think they're going to close that valuation gap, so there's a lot of upside still there.""
Watch the video above to hear what Ryan thinks is in store for LPL Financial (LPLA) as it grapples with a leadership shakeup.

What we're watching
What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
I have never been a monthly jobs report guy.
Let me explain.
The first Friday of each month, the government releases its non-farm payrolls report — as it did this past Friday, where we saw a surprisingly strong gain of 254,000. As soon as the report hits the newswires, we (media + investors) tear apart each line to get a sense of what's happening in the economy. These days the report is really used to try and predict thedirection of Fed policy.
After the initial reading frenzy, we aim to put context around it and see how it applies to the companies powering the stock market. By later in the afternoon, we shuffle along to the next market-moving story. If you are an investor, that probably means obsessing over Nvidia's (NVDA) daily price swings.
By Saturday, the jobs report is a distant memory. By Monday, it's ancient history.
The hoopla over a single data point has always seemed a bit much, especially since I've long wondered if it truly captures the real health of the economy. This thing is always revised up and down. (The prior two months were revised higher by 72,000 jobs!)
In recent years, I've rolled with the punches — reported on the numbers, asked execs about it, and tried to keep it in mind as I browse the grocery aisles.
But I still question its usefulness and accuracy, and so am forever looking for better insights into the economy.
To that end, here's the byproduct of that pursuit.
This week, I spent two days in Bentonville, Ark., meeting with the Walmart (WMT) team and walking stores. The final day concluded with an interview with its veteran CEO,Doug McMillon.
I first interviewed Doug in 2017when he was still early in his CEO tenure (he started in 2014). He appeared to be the same guy I initially met — deep thinker, fiercely competitive, and passionate about retail and Walmart's mission to save people money.
Walmart may offer the best insight into the US economy, especially as itsimproved assortment and online marketplaceis sucking in high-income shoppers and profit. Its stock is up more than 50% this year versus rival Target's (TGT) 4.3%gain.
Here's my economic exchange with Doug:
Sozzi:How challenged is the average Walmart shopper?
McMillon:People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies.
Sozzi:Do you see prices coming down and beginning to ease?
McMillon:The rate of inflation is less. But after a couple of years of inflation in dry grocery and consumables, they're settling out at a higher level, and we at Walmart don't want to accept that. We want to keep finding ways to be more efficient to get them back down. And we're not seeing those categories come down in the short term.
(I normally don't take pics with executives, but Doug's office is the original one used by Sam Walton, who I'm told used to keep a shotgun behind the door — he was a nature guy).
After I got off the plane from Arkansas, I headed into the office to get ready for anOpening Bidpodcast taping with my favorite chief economist Michelle Meyer from Mastercard Economics Institute (previously Bank of America). You can watch the full episode in the above video.
Michelle has access to a wealth of data on the economy and consumer, notably how people are spending on their credit and debit cards (she's forecasting a very solid holiday shopping season).
Here's an interesting economic takeaway from our chat:
Sozzi:Why is the labor market slowing?
Meyer:Think about pre-pandemic. If we got 250,000 jobs [each month], it would be like, oh my God, that's a statistical error. Like, how did the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that? Because the belief prior to the pandemic — and that's given the data we had seen in the labor market — trend job growth was probably in the order of 100,000, give or take a few in either direction.
So we in a way had this period of volatility in the labor market when we went from the extreme amount of job dislocation when the pandemic hit to this massive rehiring and reengagement in the workforce. Now we have to settle into something that should be more sustainable and probably more moderate as well.
The jobs report is probably useful, but I hope this piece is a reminder that there are more ways to get a clearer sense of the economy. Find them, and prosper.
Last week on this digital canvas,I recommended you go out and read three bookson AI to become a more informed investor (and dare I say, human being). A reader subsequently asked me to shed light on the best books related to AI.
So, I tapped my vast network of sources in the AI industry for their suggestions. The interesting thing is I was told not many great books existed yet (somewhat worrisome?) on the technology, more so online technical white papers.

Highlights this week include Tesla's (TSLA) expected unveiling of its self-driving robotaxi at a Thursday event as well as the release of earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday.
TheConsumer Price Index (CPI)for September comes as investors monitor inflation following theFederal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut. Minutes for the September Federal Reserve meeting will also provide insight into the central bank’s recent actions, while several Fed officials are scheduled to deliver remarks throughout the week.
Data on wholesale inflation, consumer credit, and the federal trade deficit are also on the calendar.

Wednesday, Oct. 9
Thursday, Oct. 10
Friday, Oct. 11
Tesla is expected to introduce itsself-driving “robotaxi” at a Thursday event, where the company could provide more details about several of its products.
Afterdelayingthe highly anticipated event from August,Teslawill likely show off the driverless vehicle, provide details on its costs, and possibly demonstrate the ride-sharing app used to hail the vehicle that might be called a “Cybercab,” analysts said.
In addition to the robotaxi, Tesla could also provide updates on its Optimus Bot humanoid robot, self-driving software, and a low-cost version of itselectric vehicle (EV).
Also on Thursday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices will provide updates for itsartificial intelligence (AI)products as it hosts its “Advancing AI” event, where its chief executive officer, Lisa Su, will deliver remarks.
Investors get a look at the performance of the financial services industry of late as several big banks will report 2024 third-quarter earnings on Friday.
Leading the way is JPMorgan Chase, reporting after itsprior-quarter resultsbeat analyst expectations on strong revenue from its investment banking services.  Earnings for the country’s largest bank come after anexecutive last month lowered expectationsfornet interest incomefollowing the Federal Reserve’s move to lower interest rates.
Wells Fargo reported adecline in net interest incomein its second-quarter report, despite its results coming in ahead of analyst projections. BlackRock will deliver earnings after it reported a record$10.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM)in the prior quarter.
Delta Air Lines’ report on Thursday will offer insight into theair carrier’s performanceduring the summer travel season, while soda maker PepsiCo will deliver its financials afterscaling back its growth outlookamid mixed results in its previous quarter.
Market watchers will get a look at whether inflation continued to decline in September with the Thursday release of CPI. With recent data showing that price increases continue to slow, market participants are looking to see if inflation continues to trend down toward the Federal Reserve’s target.
Easing price pressures prompted theFed to reduce its key federal funds ratein September, which influences borrowing costs across the economy. Updated inflation data could send signals about the next moves for the central bank.
Throughout the week, investors will have an opportunity to hear individual Fed officials’ thoughts on interest rates and the economy.Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman’sremarks on Friday will come after the inflation report, while New York Fed President John Williams, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are also on the week's speaking calendar.
The Fed will also release the minutes from its Sept. 17-18 meeting on Wednesday, providing another look at how monetary officials are viewing the current economy.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-140007360.html,10:00AM,Finviz.com,"The market expects The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 11, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.5%.
Revenues are expected to be $4.51 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.43%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.
So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of +5.59%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
The Bank of New York Mellon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

BNY Mellon Municipal Income, Inc., trading under the symbol DMF, operates as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company in the USA. Since its IPO on November 25, 1991, DMF aims to maximize tax-exempt current income, consistent with capital preservation, by investing in municipal obligations. With a market capitalization of $151.919 million and a stock price of $7.3188, the company's financial health and market performance are crucial for investors. The stock has seen a year-to-date increase of 12.25% in its price.
The recent reduction by Saba Capital was executed at a trade price of $7.31 per share. This adjustment in their DMF holdings marks a strategic shift, possibly aligning with broader portfolio optimization goals or reactions to market conditions. The transaction's minimal impact on the firms portfolio suggests a tactical rather than a fundamental shift in Saba Capital's investment strategy regarding DMF.
Following the transaction, DMF's stock showed a slight increase of 0.12%. However, the stock's overall performance and the firm's strategic reduction raise questions about the underlying reasons, possibly linked to DMF's currentGF Scoreof 33/100, indicating potential underperformance.
Saba Capitals portfolio is heavily inclined towards high-yield opportunities, with DMF being a part of its strategy to leverage tax-exempt income. The firms reduction in DMF could be a recalibration towards other opportunities within or outside its top sectors, aiming to optimize returns amidst changing market dynamics.
DMF's financial metrics such as a PE Ratio of 19.67 and a Cash to Debt ratio of 0.05 highlight its financial stance in the market. Despite these figures, the stock's GF Value and other valuation metrics likeGF Value Rankare currently not applicable, which complicates the valuation process.
Saba Capital Managements recent reduction in BNY Mellon Municipal Income, Inc. reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a shift in investment philosophy. This move, aligned with the firm's broader market strategies, underscores the dynamic nature of asset management and the continuous assessment required to maintain a high-performing portfolio. Investors and market watchers will find it prudent to monitor such transactions, as they often precede significant market shifts or internal strategy realignments.

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Could Be a Great Choice,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-154513200.html,Sep-25-24 11:45AM,Finviz.com,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.
Based in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 37.98%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.47 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.62%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.24%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.55%.
In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.88 is up 19% from last year. Over the last 5 years, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.84%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon's current payout ratio is 31%. This means it paid out 31% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.
BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.63 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.49%.
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.
For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BK is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

US0640581007,BK,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Diversified Bank Stock Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-104936860.html,06:49AM,Finviz.com,"We recently compiled a list of the10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) stands against the other diversified bank stocks.
With 2024 heading to a close, the banking industry continues to be one of the most dynamic ones. While consumer and media attention has been fixated on technology due to the revolutionary potential offered by artificial intelligence, banks have slowly been adjusting to the market, industry, and economic conditions created by 24 year high interest rates in America.
The usual culprit behind the turmoil is the Federal Reserve. After the mini banking crisis in America last year that sawsome of the biggest banks go under, Federal Reserve officials sped up rule changes to ensure that the biggest banks in America can maintain stability. These banks are called Global Systematically Important Banks (GSIBs) and they are selected on the basis of criteria that determine their importance to the global financial systems.
The initial set of these rules called the Basel III Endgame, would significantly increase the capital that GSIBs would have had to set aside to maintain stability. Within these banks, the largest would be required to increase their RiskWeighted Assets (RWAs) to jump. to 20%, with analysts expecting back then that banks would have to set aside their retained earnings (post net income money usually returned to shareholders or used to fund growth) for as much as four years to fund the. new requirements.
Naturally, the big banks weren't pleased. Not only did thenew rulespropose disallowing the banks' use of internal risk models to determine capital requirements, but they also targeted non interest income by including it in the calculations for determining operational risk. This income stream covers different areas, such as fees from payment processing and card transactions, and it had become a great way for big banks in particular to beef up their income statement during 2020 when interest rates were at a historic low. According todatafrom S&P Market Intelligence, banks with assets greater than $10 billion saw their noninterest income rise by 3.5% between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022. The growth trend was sharper for the broader industry over a longer horizon. Between Q1 2019 and Q1 2022, net interest income for US banks fell by 0.89% while noninterest income jumped by 17.2%.
The resistance from the banks worked, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shared with Congress in March that he was ""confident that the final product will be one that has broad support at the Fed and in the broader world."" The Fed Chair was particularly moved by results from an independent study that showed that 97% of the comments submitted in response to the rules were critical of them. The banks' push back came right when Basel regulators proposed changing the way in which big banks calculate their GSIB surcharge, to prevent them from window dressing their risk metrics at year end. According tocalculationsfrom Reuters, a 0.5% reduction in the GSIB surcharge saves America's top two biggest banks a cumulative $16 billion, and the changes in this area could require the banks to use the average of their daily risk values during the reporting year.
Powell's comments were followed by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr announcing in September that the new rules would now require big banks' capital to increase by 9% as opposed to 19%. For banks with assets lower than $250 billion, their capital would increase between 3% to 4%, Barr added. The Fed official commented to reporters that ""there are benefits and costs to increasing capital requirements. The changes we intend to make will bring these two important objectives into better balance, in light of the feedback we have received.""
Sounds good right? Think again, as banks and their investors weren't pleased. The day Barr announced the new rules, the S&P's bank stock index dropped by 2.70% before paring some of the losses to close 0.82% lower. However, bank investors weren't disappointedonlyby the new rules. They were also digesting comments from top banking executives at the Barclays conference in New York; comments which saw the bank stock index drop by 3.1% the day after Barr released the vastly friendlier rules to close 1% lower.
At the conference, Goldman's CEO warned that the bank could experience a 10% drop in trading revenue or the revenue that it earns from trading fixed income securities, currencies, and commodities. Citi CFO Mark Mason warned that market revenue could drop by 4%, while JPM's operations chief Daniel Pino warned investors that their net interest income expectations were too high. The bank's shares fell by 7.5% and closed the day 5.2% lower.
However, not all is dour for bank stock investors. According to McKinsey's 2023 Annual Banking Review, the industry's net interest margin improvements courtesy of high interest ratesgrewprofits by $280 billion in 2022 and bumped the return on equity (ROE) to 12%. Global banking net income sat at a six year high of $1.3 trillion in 2022, and the report projected it to further grow to $1.4 trillion in 2023.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), the bank founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1984, is a GSIB. This places it at the heart of the ongoing tussle between the Federal Reserve and big banks over the Fed's decision to implement tighter capital requirements that could eat into banking retained earnings for at least two years. However, investors have brushed this off, as The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)'s shares are up by 51.7% over the past year and by 31.45% year to date. Key to this performance has been the bank's remarkable ability to keep its costs under control even as inflation still hasn't dropped fully.

Additionally, a sizeable $4.6 billion of its $7 billion in H1 noninterest income was through investment services fees. This provides The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) exposure to rate cut tailwinds to the stock and investment markets, with the bank benefiting as stock, M&A, and other associated activities pick up.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)'s management shed more light on its investment services revenue during theQ2 2024 earnings call:
""Total investment services fees were up 3% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business. We continue to see strong momentum in ETF servicing with AUC/A of over $2 trillion, up more than 50% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced up over 20% year-on-year.
Overall BKranks 5thon our list of the best diversified bank stocks to buy now.

US0640581007,BK,Why Wall Street is on board with bigger rate cuts in Q4,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wall-street-is-on-board-with-bigger-rate-cuts-in-q4-150028728.html,Sep-22-24 11:00AM,Finviz.com,"The bulls are back and investors are chasing the market higher.
Last weekI wrote aboutwhy a 50 basis point interest rate cut could be a mistake, as experts told me a bold move by the Fed could signal doom and gloom for the economy and risk triggering a market sell-off.
Yet, a week later, Wall Street seemed to be on board with the larger rate cut as stocks jumped torecord highs.
And traders are betting the Fed will keep up its aggressive pace of easing. While the central bank signaled another 50 basis points of cuts across its two remaining 2024 meetings, traders are pricing in an additional 75 basis points, according to theCME Group's FedWatch tool.
Experts tell me it’s cooling inflation, not a rising risk of recession, that will give the Fed the green light for another large cut. Prices fell to a three-year low in August.
“If [inflation] continues to ease, interest rates should be lowered in line with that,” Nationwide Mutual's chief economist Kathy Bostjancic explained.
“The Fed Reserve should go 50 basis points for the next [meeting],"" Bostjancic added. ""They're far from neutral, so cutting 50 basis points is not necessarily a sign the economy is falling apart. It's a recognition that policy is just too restrictive.”
The Federal Reserve is set to release its next interest rate decision on Nov. 7 and will have another chance to cut rates at its December meeting.

If the past week is a guide, an aggressive cut could be a catalyst for the market. Powell’s emphasis that the Fed's move should be viewed as “a sign of our commitment not to get behind"" was enough to boost investor confidence. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) notched its 39th record high of the year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) surged above 42,000.
“The Fed was able to cut by 50 basis points not because it had to but because it was able to, and I think that's a really really key distinction,” Raymond James' chief market strategist Matt Orton said onYahoo Finance’s Morning Brief.
“It supports more investment, it supports more [capital expenditures], and that is what has been behind a lot of the economic resilience.”
John Hancock’sEmily Roland told meincreased optimism of a soft landing is driving “a lot of optimism across markets.”
“Riskier assets are really celebrating this idea that the Fed can stave off a hard landing and do it proactively before we see more weakness here in the labor market,” Roland said.
BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski raised his year-end S&P 500 price target to a street high of 6,100, noting historical performance patterns “suggest a stronger-than-normal 4Q is likely in store for the market and especially since the Fed has shifted to easing mode.""
Two key jobs reports will help guide the Fed on the size of its next rate cut. In a note to clients on Friday, Oxford Economics’ Michael Pearce warned that further softening in the labor market might prompt the Fed to shave off 50 basis points sooner rather than later.
“Considering the shift toward an easing bias from Federal Reserve officials, any downside surprises to the labor market data could push them to deliver another 50bp cut in November,” Pearce wrote.

US5949181045,MSFT,DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-sell-off-reminds-investors-of-the-biggest-earnings-story-holding-up-the-stock-market-141101978.html,Yahoo Finance•1 hour ago,Yahoo Finance,"Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not onlywhat's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.
New developmentsfrom Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.
Nvidia stock dropped more than than 11%. Meanwhile fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more in early trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.
""When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief investment strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. ""That’s exactly what we’re seeing today.""
A slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With withindex valuations near multi-decade highsand the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.
But unlike other risks likehigher interest ratesorsticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.
In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead,causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the ""Magnificent Seven"" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.
As Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""

US5949181045,MSFT,DeepSeek unveils new R1 open-source AI model,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-unveils-r1-open-source-151240103.html,Verdict•16 minutes ago,Yahoo Finance,"China-based AI startup DeepSeek has released an open-source version of its reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, claiming it matches OpenAI's o1 on certain AI benchmarks.
Said to challenge OpenAI's dominance in the AI sector with its competitive performance and cost-effective pricing, R1 is the firm’s latest open-source reasoning model, following a preview launch in November 2024, reportedZDNET.
DeepSeek’s R1 is made available on the Hugging Face platform under the MIT license, allowing unrestricted commercial use, reportedTechCrunch.
In a post on social mediaX, the company said that R1 beats or is on par with OpenAI's o1 in benchmarks such as AIME, MATH-500, and SWE-bench Verified.
In addition to the 671-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek has introduced six smaller ""distilled"" versions, with the smallest comprising 1.5 billion parameters, enabling operation on local devices.
Recently, researchers from University of California in Berkeley also introduced an open-source model that rivals o1-preview, achieving this milestone in just 19 hours and at a cost of approximately $450.
R1's pricing is said to be disruptive, offering API access at $0.14 per million tokens, significantly undercutting OpenAI's $7.50 rate for the same amount of data.
OpenAI currently promotes ChatGPT Pro with unlimited o1 access for $2,400 annually.
R1, however, has limitation as it must comply with China's internet regulations. This require R1’s responses to align with ""core socialist values."", reportedTechCrunch.
In a separate announcement, DeepSeek has developed a free, open-source large-language model using reduced-capability chips, H800s, from Nvidia, reportedCNBC.
The model has been developed in two months and at a cost of less than $6m.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was quoted byCNBCas saying: “To see the DeepSeek new model, it’s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient.
“We should take the developments [coming] out of China very, very seriously.”

US5949181045,MSFT,Tevogen Bio and Microsoft expand AI collaboration to PredicTcell tech,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tevogen-bio-microsoft-expand-ai-150141243.html,Pharmaceutical Technology•27 minutes ago,Yahoo Finance,"Tevogen Bio has expanded its partnership with Microsoft, aiming to further its AI-centred collaboration and advance its predictive precision T-cell targeting technology, PredicTcell.
The strategic move is set to leverage Microsoft's cloud capabilities, AI and health and life sciences expertise to speed up the detection of target and pre-clinical processes, enhancing Tevogen’s immunotherapy pipeline.
Microsoft's advanced AI tools and the Azure cloud platform will be integrated by Tevogen.AI, the AI division of Tevogen Bio, into two key objectives.
The aim is the rapid expansion of the ExacTcell Technology pre-clinical pipeline, based on the trial outcomes of TVGN 489.
By utilising machine learning for critical simulations, the company expects to accelerate the discovery of new targets through the analysis of extensive genomic datasets with enhanced speed and precision.
The partnership is set to develop algorithms for decoding interactions between human leukocyte antigens and T-cells.
This is anticipated to advance the company's understanding of immune responses and pave the way for new therapeutic opportunities.
Tevogen Bio chief information officer and Tevogen.AI head Mittul Mehta stated: “As we expand our AI efforts, this broader relationship with Microsoft represents a key milestone in our ongoing journey to revolutionise immunotherapy.
“Through deeper collaboration with Microsoft domain experts, we will further harness the power of AI to bring more precise and personalised treatments to patients at an accelerated pace.”
Tevogen Bio is also exploring human papillomavirus (HPV) treatments through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and AI tools.
A protein dataset from the HPV genome was curated by the company and is in the process of detecting cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) targets for a trial of Tevogen’s first oncology product candidate, TVGN 920.
With its ExacTcell technology, which trains CTLs to identify certain targets and then expands them, the company is poised to deliver an HPV-specific CTL treatment.
This expanded relationship with Microsoft builds ona previous partnership established in November 2024to advance the development of an HPV-specific CTL treatment.

US5949181045,MSFT,Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Is Nosediving,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-microsoft-msft-stock-nosediving-145725984.html,StockStory•31 minutes ago,Yahoo Finance,"Shares of tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 7.1% in the pre-market session as stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.
Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model ""super impressive"" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,"" he added.
Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia—whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.
Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Microsoft?Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
Microsoft’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 4% after President Trump announced a $500 billion Stargate project (Joint Venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank) to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri thinks players such as Nvidia would significantly benefit, likely as the supplier of critical semiconductor chips powering some of the anticipated infrastructure requirements, including data centers. As a result, it is not hard to project the anticipated gains from hyperscalers such as Oracle, Microsoft and other cloud platforms.
Overall, the deal should accelerate demand for builders and innovators within the AI space.
Also buoying the tech sector was Netflix. The company reported strong Q4 earnings results. Specifically, global streaming paid membership exceeded Wall Street expectations, with a strong net add figure (18.9 million vs. estimates of 9.8 million). This led to a revenue and EPS beat in the quarter. Additionally, revenue guidance for 2025 beat expectations, and the company spoke optimistically about multiple vectors such as ad revenue, live events, and new content. Overall, the results were impressive.
Microsoft is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $429.27 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $467.56 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Microsoft’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,646.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

US5949181045,MSFT,"DeepSeek launch rattles tech stocks with Microsoft, Meta earnings on deck",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-launch-rattles-tech-stocks-143901613.html,TheStreet•50 minutes ago,Yahoo Finance,"The biggest U.S. tech stocks could shed as much as $900 billion in value Monday amid a global selloff tied to the launch of an AI-powered chatbot in China that could challenge the basis of capital-spending plans and profit forecasts heading into the fourth-quarter earnings season.
DeepSeek, a China-based tech startup formed in 2023, claims that in a bit more than two months at a cost of around $6 million, it developed a large-language-model system that equals or surpasses the performance of Microsoft(MSFT)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT.
The rapid development through open-sourced collaboration, at a fraction of the cost of the $500 million-plus spent by Meta Platforms(META)Llama 3 and OpenAI's ChatGPT, has shaken the tech world and rattled investor confidence in the massive capital-spending plans of the world's biggest hyperscalers.
Microsoft, Meta, Amazon(AMZN)and Google parent Alphabet(GOOGL)are likely to spend as much as $300 billion on AI projects this year alone, with estimates for overall spending on the world's hottest technology over the next three years pegged at around $2 trillion.
The U.S. government is also moving quickly to ensure that the U.S. remains the epicenter of AI development. President Donald Trump last week unveiled a three-way joint venture of Oracle(ORCL), Japan-based SoftBank and OpenAI that he claims will invest as much as $500 billion in domestic AI infrastructure.
But with the biggest U.S. tech stocks set to update investors on their fourth-quarter profits over the next two weeks — starting Wednesday with reports from Microsoft and Meta — investors are questioning both their current market values and their massive spending plans.
""Monday's tech selloff is being driven by a fundamental catalyst, which is worries that China's DeepSeek AI tool is surpassing ChatGPT in usage and therefore requiring less complex chips from the likes of Nvidia,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, Calif.

""But the idea that this level of spending on AI may not be necessary or prudent to begin with — well, that could prove to be a fundamental game-changer"" for the broader tech sector itself, he added.
And that has major implication for the market's long bull rally, which entered its third year this month largely on the back of outsized gains in the tech space and the broader outperformance of the megacap leaders.
The Magnificent 7, in fact, are likely to contribute around a fifth of the 10.5% profit growth forecast for the S&P 500 over the three months ended in December, even as their overall earnings are set to advance at the slowest pace in nearly two years.
The collective value of the seven largest stocks, meanwhile, accounts for around a third of the S&P 500's overall market value, which explains the outsized reaction to the DeepSeek news in early Monday trading.
""U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet commanding forward price-to-earnings multiples far above historical averages,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist for Saxo Bank in Singapore.
""With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices,"" she added.

Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, sees the forthcoming Mag 7 earnings slate as a ""key moment for the market, with the sector’s high valuations under scrutiny.""
""The Mag 7 accounts for about 33% of the S&P 500’s market cap and any signs of slowing growth or cautious guidance could push forward earnings multiples down from the current 21 times level,"" he said. ""A shift to 17 or 18 times earnings would imply a notable market pullback, highlighting the risk tied to this concentrated group.""
Microsoft, which earlier this month said it was on track to spend around $80 billion in its current fiscal year ""to build out AI-enabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world,"" will report fiscal-second-quarter results after the close of trading Wednesday.
Analysts are looking for overall revenue of $68.84 billion and Intelligent cloud revenue, which includes its flagship cloud offering Azure, of around $28.1 billion.
""We still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 (in the second half of the financial year] as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand,"" Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, told investors in late October.

Overall revenue growth of around 11% will outpace the 6% gain expected in earnings per share, which are forecast to come in at $3.13, putting further pressures on Microsoft to monetize its massive capital spending plans.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which also is set to report December-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said last week it would spend around $65 billion this year on AI training, inferencing and broader product development.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that higher-than-expected tally a ""massive effort that will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership.""
Meta is expected to post a fourth-quarter bottom line of of $6.77 a share, up 27% from the year-earlier period, and revenue rising 17% to $47 billion.
Tesla also reports Wednesday, with investors likely to focus on CEO Elon Musk's spending plans and broader AI ambitions.
Apple will report December-quarter earnings after trading closes Thursday, while Alphabet and Amazon are set to report next week. Nvidia rounds out the Mag 7 earnings season with an update scheduled for Feb. 26.
""We do not expect big tech earnings over the next two weeks will justify the sector's elevated valuations,"" Bahnsen at Bahnsen Group said.
""These companies may very well report a wonderful quarter, and they may guide higher for intended orders and revenue expectations. Current valuations do not factor in the risks of competition, which seems inevitable, and risks of diminished order books in the future, and all the other reasons that lofty valuations eventually revert to the mean,"" he argued.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, says the market is overestimating DeepSeek's competitive threat to the U.S. tech giants. He sees the current selloff as a ""golden opportunity"" to enter the AI trade heading into 2025 and beyond.
""While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact, the reality is that Mag 7 and US tech is focused on the AGI endgame with all the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view,"" he said.
""The focus of AI right now is the enterprise use cases and broader infrastructure propelling this $2 trillion of [capital expenditures] over the next three years,"" he added.
""Next will be physical AI around robotics and autonomous. DeepSeek is not stopping it [and] to some extent it might actually accelerate capex for the hyperscalers.""

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dropped sharply in premarket trading, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also declining. Other AI-related stocks, including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), faced significant pressure.
Wedbush analysts acknowledged that DeepSeek R1 presents a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance but believe the Magnificent 7 remain focused on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and enterprise AI applications, driving $2 trillion in capital expenditures over the next three years. DeepSeek, an offshoot of a Chinese hedge fund, developed its open-source AI model in two months for $5.57 million.
However, analysts noted that this figure excludes prior research and testing costs. Wedbush also questioned whether DeepSeek bypassed U.S. export controls restricting access to Nvidia's H800 GPUs, saying it ""remains to be seen"" if the company found a workaround.

US5949181045,MSFT,Does China's AI push spell trouble for the US Big Tech stocks? Have your say,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-tech-stocks-deepseek-nvidia-142104571.html,Yahoo Finance UK•1 hour ago,Yahoo Finance,"Tech stocks slid on Monday morning, as advances by Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek sparked concerns about increased competition, raising doubts about the level of spending in this space in the US.
DeepSeek develops open-source large language models and its app has been climbing up the download charts, with the company launching its R1 model last week.
The start-up claims that the new model offers ""performance on-par"" with the OpenAI o1 model. DeepSeek also said that its AI assistant runs off lower cost chips and uses less data than leading models.
Techstocks tumbledas investors appeared spooked by these advancements. Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) fell, with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) plunging nearly 12% in pre-market trading. Other tech stocks felt the pain too, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (META) both falling more than 4% before the bell.
Meanwhile, Dutch company ASML (ASML.AS), which makes lithography machines that are key to making chips, was down 8% in early afternoon trading in Europe.

Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: ""DeepSeek’s success will serve to intensify the US-China AI war, particularly following the recent announcement of the 'Stargate' project in the US.""
Last week, newly reinstated US president Donald Trumpunveiled the $500bn ""Stargate"" project, a private-sector investment plan to build AI infrastructure in the US. The project is backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI, with Nvidia and Microsoft also named among the key initial technology partners.
Barringer said the DeepSeek developments also provide a ""wake-up call and somewhat of a question mark on how much needs to be spent in order to build a model, and whether quite the level of CapEx we have been seeing is really required.""
He added: ""However, bringing the price of model training down is no bad thing as it will help to lower the entry point and this price elasticity could help drive usage and volume.""

The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company.
Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery.
Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.
Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility.
Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

US5949181045,MSFT,Global book publishers sue OpenAI for copyright violations in,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-book-publishers-sue-openai-123937217.html,Verdict•2 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"Indian book publishers and their international partners have filed a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI in New Delhi, alleging misuse of proprietary content, reportedReutersciting a representative.
The case, which was filed in December 2024, alleges OpenAI, an AI research company backed by Microsoft, of improperly accessing proprietary content for its ChatGPT chatbot.
The Federation of Indian Publishers, representing a coalition that includes Penguin Random House, Bloomsbury, Cambridge University Press, and Pan Macmillan, as well as Indian publishers Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co, has filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court.
The federation's legal action seeks to address concerns that OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has been using copyrighted material without permission.
Despite the allegations, OpenAI has maintained that its AI systems are designed to make fair use of publicly available data.
The Indian federation's filing in December, reviewed by Reuters, claims to have ""credible evidence/information"" that OpenAI has utilised their literary works to train ChatGPT.
The matter was initially reviewed by a court registrar in New Delhi, who, on 10 January 2025, instructed OpenAI to respond to the allegations.
The case is set to be heard by a judge on 28 January.
The Federation general secretary Pranav Gupta was cited by the news agency as saying in an interview about the lawsuit: ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content.
“In case they don't want to do licensing with us, they should delete datasets used in AI training and explain how we will be compensated. This impacts creativity.”
In November last year, Indian news agency ANI sued OpenAI in Delhi, accusing it of using ANI's content without permission to train ChatGPT.
However, OpenAI responded on 10 January with an 86-page filing at the Delhi High Court, addressing ANI's demand to delete its data from ChatGPT.
OpenAI has argued that complying with an order to delete training data would conflict with its US legal obligations and that Indian courts lack jurisdiction since its servers are not located in India,reported the news agency.
However, the federation contends that OpenAI's provision of services in India should subject the company to Indian copyright laws.

The company’s stock was slightly down by about 0.6% at $444.06 per share at the end of the trading day on Friday.
The tech giant is expected to report revenues of $68.9 billion for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Net income for the quarter ended in December is estimated to be $23.3 billion, while earnings per share is expected at $3.11.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has joined a slew of tech companies — including its longstanding partner, OpenAI — on a$500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure projectcalled Stargate, that was announced by President Donald Trump last week. Microsoft is one of the project’s “key technology partners,” OpenAI said.
The project builds upon Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship, the startup said, adding that it plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service alongside “additional compute” from Stargate.
Microsoft said that itsnew agreementwith OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. The company is OpenAI’s largest investor, and had been itsexclusive compute provider.
“To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said.

Existing investors from Perplexity AI and ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. The deal's financing would involve third-party capital providers, enabling a one-time dividend payment to ByteDance investors in exchange for simplified governance. The previous offer was valued at over $50 billion, but the final amount will depend on ByteDance shareholders' participation.
Perplexity AI, a rising competitor to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reached a $9 billion valuation by late 2024 amid growing demand for generative AI. It is among several firms, including Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and potentially Elon Musk, exploring TikTok-related deals.

US5949181045,MSFT,Oxford Street suffers fresh blow as Microsoft shuts flagship store,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oxford-street-suffers-fresh-blow-102809011.html,The Telegraph•5 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"London’s Oxford Street has been dealt a fresh blow after Microsoft confirmed the closure of its flagship London store.
The US tech giant said it would be shutting its so-called experience centre in February, six years after it first opened.
Bosses said the decision to close the 21,000 sq ft store stems from the company’s push for “digital growth”, leaving Britain’s busiest shopping street with another prominent space to fill.
The three-storey store opened with great fanfare in 2019, boasting giant video walls and an Xbox gaming lounge.
A Microsoft spokesman said: “To better align with its focus on digital growth, Microsoft has decided to exit the lease at the Microsoft Experience Centre in London early.
“We regularly review our locations and our workforce to ensure we are aligning to market opportunities and make changes to meet the demands of the business.”
The closure, first reported by Windows Central, marks a fresh setback for Oxford Street.
Nike recently confirmed that it is temporarily shutting its NikeTown megastore to prepare for a “grand reopening”, while Ikea hasdelayed the launchof its new London flagship at the former Topshop store until spring.
It has also recently emerged that a clutch of fashion retailersdo not intend to renew their leases on Oxford Streetonce they expire, according to planning documents filed with Westminster City Council earlier this month.
The retailers include Zara, River Island, Urban Outfitters, Swarovski and Bershka.
Oxford Street was once the retail sector’s crown jewel but has suffered in recent years from a series of high-profile closures. This has led to an influx of American candy shops and souvenir sellers.
Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Machinpreviously described the streetas a “national embarrassment”.
However, some brands have continued to put their faith in the shopping street, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and HMV.
Abercrombie is opening a two-floor shop after closing its Regent Street site, while HMV returned to its former store near Bond Street station in 2023.
In an effort to turn its fortunes around, Sir Sadiq Khan has set out plans to pedestrianise the street as part of a £150m investment plan.
Sir Sadiq said last year: “Oxford Street was once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s retail sector, but there’s no doubt that it has suffered hugely over the last decade. Urgent action is needed to give the nation’s most famous high street a new lease of life.”
However, the Mayor of London’s plans have proved controversial with the Labour-run Westminster City Council, businesses and residents, which have raised several concerns including the project’s scope to displace traffic to nearby streets.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US5949181045,MSFT,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

Source: Ycharts
None of the top 3 names by market cap, i.e. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are beating the S&P 500 YTD. (Apple had a very tough day yesterday, January 16th, ’25, as Apple and the QQQ’s fell 3.5% and 4% respectively. )
Here’s how the Top 10 names by market cap rank in terms of YTD ’25 performance, best to worst:
Source: Ycharts, as of Thursday close, January 15, ’25
What’s interesting to me is that the top 3 market-cap weights and the largest 3 names in the S&P 500 by market cap weight are down the most YTD in ’25. As of last night’s close that is 19% – 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap weight, and 25% – 26% of the QQQ’s market cap weight.
As readers can probably surmise, you should watch for “rotation”, or the move out of large-cap growth and large-cap tech, into the other asset classes, like mid-cap and small-cap (whether growth or value, it won’t matter), and international too.

The above spreadsheet is this blog’s annual returns for the various asset classes, which is updated to track the potential rotation, from large-cap growth to the other equity asset classes.
As of the end of ’24, there isn’t hard evidence of a rotation yet.
The style-box returns are just as they have been for the secular bull market that started either March 9, 2009 or on January 1, 2010.
It’s likely we will need to see Q4 ’24 earnings and guidance for the S&P 500 Top 10 names to see if there’s any material difference in expectations.
This blog has been cautious since last summer on the AI frenzy and the Nvidia / semiconductor trade, which might have been premature. Taiwan Semi had a good quarter this week, with better-than-expected revenue guidance. Micron’s stock is holding up well, despite horrid guidance and estimate revisions.
Here’s this blog’s top 10 holdings for clients as of 12/31/24:
The majority of clients have balanced accounts under some form of the 60% / 40% asset allocation, with this blog adjusting the equity / fixed income based on market conditions.
The JP Morgan Income Fund (JMSIX) beat the Barclays (LON:BARC) Aggregate in 2024 by around 650 bp’s in ’24. That’s the “credit over duration” trade, that lasts only as long as the US economy stays healthy.
The biggest single position change was the reduction in Microsoft’s weight in the 3rd quarter ’24. It’s spending a lot of money on AI capex, and the CoPilot launch seemed to be received in a luke-warm fashion. Satya Nadella did a fantastic job with the cloud and Azure, but I worry the AI transition might not go as smoothly.
Some larger clients have 100% equity portfolios, that have a big influence on the Top 10 holdings.
Many of these positions have been held for years.
The last Top 10 holdings posted was way back in early July ’24, when this blog turned more cautious on the large-cap growth trade, but large-cap and growth still performed well in full-year ’24.
I was surprised looking at the style box and the difference in large-cap growth and value in the 2nd half of ’24. Large-cap value didn’t hold up all that well in back half of ’24.
Everything about this post-Covid rally in US stocks has been dominated by AI, Nvidia and semiconductors, and personally Im staying away from that trade, with the exception of smaller trades in larger accounts.
Within most clients balanced accounts, the financial sector is the largest overweight relative to the S&P 500’s financial sector weight of 13%, thus that turned out to be a big winner in late ’24. Some small amounts of JP Morgan are being trimmed in early ’25, while the stocks like Schwab (SCHW) and the KRE (regional bank ETF), should win with a steeper yield curve, and remain below their 2021 high prints.

There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle.

Stock buybacks are hitting record highs as companies with excessive amounts of cash on hand want to keep shareholders happy with short-term share appreciation. Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Oracle  (NYSE:ORCL) , and Microsoft rank amongst the largest stock repurchasers of 2019 so far.

Through the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.
AAPL has bought back roughly a quarter trillion dollars’ worth of its own stock over the past 5-years, while Oracle and Microsoft come in at over $70 billion in the same time frame.
These are some of the most cash rich companies in the world, but are they putting their cash to good use?
Productive Use of Money
Are share buybacks the most productive use of funds for producing long term shareholder returns? There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle. This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.
The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.
The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.
Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.
Back to Microsoft
Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US5949181045,MSFT,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Stock buybacks are hitting record highs as companies with excessive amounts of cash on hand want to keep shareholders happy with short-term share appreciation. Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Oracle  (NYSE:ORCL) , and Microsoft rank amongst the largest stock repurchasers of 2019 so far.

Through the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.
AAPL has bought back roughly a quarter trillion dollars’ worth of its own stock over the past 5-years, while Oracle and Microsoft come in at over $70 billion in the same time frame.
These are some of the most cash rich companies in the world, but are they putting their cash to good use?
Productive Use of Money
Are share buybacks the most productive use of funds for producing long term shareholder returns? There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle. This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.
The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.
The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.
Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.
Back to Microsoft
Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.
There is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Old Tech — MSFT — Topping?,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-old-tech-—-msft-—-topping-214903,"Jun 04, 2014",Investing.com,"As of late, all I hear is people in the media talking about the move in old tech stocks, and how new money should be put to work in names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and so on. This should make you wonder, why where the talking heads not saying this while these stocks were 10, 20 and in some cases, over 30% off their highs?At the beginning of 2013, MSFT Microsoft was trading at only $26.28. Since then, the stock has been one of the new leaders in the market, reaching a high of $41.66 earlier this year. That is an unbelievable run, especially for a company of the size of MSFT.Looking back in time, yes MSFT was a great bargain at those levels. But remember something important, back then no one wanted to buy MSFT, or so they claimed on the different media outlets. As traders and investors we must always be aware of what is behind the words of these media talking heads. Their main goal is to create hype and get the small investor caught up in the moment. The reason they do that is simple, ratings! They are hosting TV shows, they need people to watch their shows. Or maybe they are selling newspapers, well, someone needs to buy the papers folks. Institutions know the role of the media all too well and use it to feed the public information for their benefit; so they can sell their shares at the highs and buy them back at the lows. For this one simple reason, you should never chase any equity. If a stock has run up on the back of media hype, run away! Learn how to utilize the charts to your advantage by reading them correctly and you will allow yourself to be a buyer when institutions are buying and a seller when they sell.Let's take a look at Microsoft's chart below and see what it is telling us regarding buying or selling the equity now:As you can see, MSFT peaked at a high of $41.66, and it is now trading just a little below that high at $40.79. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Trust recently reached a multi year high of $91.45. However, as noted by the chart above, MSFT has put in lower highs and recently made a new lower low at $38.51, before rallying back intra day to close above an important support level at $38.98.This is bearish for the equity, and perhaps a sign of distribution. If MSFT closes below $38.51 on a daily basis, it should quickly fall further. This equity should not be chased at these levels. A level that could be in play for a short term move up from is $37.18. Another level that you can keep on your buy list and will offer an opportunity for a longer term hold, will be the $35.04, depending on how and if MSFT gets there.BY Kiliam Lopez

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US5949181045,MSFT,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.
There is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Old Tech — MSFT — Topping?,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-old-tech-—-msft-—-topping-214903,"Jun 04, 2014",Investing.com,"As of late, all I hear is people in the media talking about the move in old tech stocks, and how new money should be put to work in names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and so on. This should make you wonder, why where the talking heads not saying this while these stocks were 10, 20 and in some cases, over 30% off their highs?At the beginning of 2013, MSFT Microsoft was trading at only $26.28. Since then, the stock has been one of the new leaders in the market, reaching a high of $41.66 earlier this year. That is an unbelievable run, especially for a company of the size of MSFT.Looking back in time, yes MSFT was a great bargain at those levels. But remember something important, back then no one wanted to buy MSFT, or so they claimed on the different media outlets. As traders and investors we must always be aware of what is behind the words of these media talking heads. Their main goal is to create hype and get the small investor caught up in the moment. The reason they do that is simple, ratings! They are hosting TV shows, they need people to watch their shows. Or maybe they are selling newspapers, well, someone needs to buy the papers folks. Institutions know the role of the media all too well and use it to feed the public information for their benefit; so they can sell their shares at the highs and buy them back at the lows. For this one simple reason, you should never chase any equity. If a stock has run up on the back of media hype, run away! Learn how to utilize the charts to your advantage by reading them correctly and you will allow yourself to be a buyer when institutions are buying and a seller when they sell.Let's take a look at Microsoft's chart below and see what it is telling us regarding buying or selling the equity now:As you can see, MSFT peaked at a high of $41.66, and it is now trading just a little below that high at $40.79. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Trust recently reached a multi year high of $91.45. However, as noted by the chart above, MSFT has put in lower highs and recently made a new lower low at $38.51, before rallying back intra day to close above an important support level at $38.98.This is bearish for the equity, and perhaps a sign of distribution. If MSFT closes below $38.51 on a daily basis, it should quickly fall further. This equity should not be chased at these levels. A level that could be in play for a short term move up from is $37.18. Another level that you can keep on your buy list and will offer an opportunity for a longer term hold, will be the $35.04, depending on how and if MSFT gets there.BY Kiliam Lopez

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US5949181045,MSFT,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.Back to MicrosoftMicrosoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure.

Through the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.

This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.
The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.
The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.
Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.
Back to Microsoft
Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.
There is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Old Tech — MSFT — Topping?,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-old-tech-—-msft-—-topping-214903,"Jun 04, 2014",Investing.com,"As of late, all I hear is people in the media talking about the move in old tech stocks, and how new money should be put to work in names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and so on. This should make you wonder, why where the talking heads not saying this while these stocks were 10, 20 and in some cases, over 30% off their highs?At the beginning of 2013, MSFT Microsoft was trading at only $26.28. Since then, the stock has been one of the new leaders in the market, reaching a high of $41.66 earlier this year. That is an unbelievable run, especially for a company of the size of MSFT.Looking back in time, yes MSFT was a great bargain at those levels. But remember something important, back then no one wanted to buy MSFT, or so they claimed on the different media outlets. As traders and investors we must always be aware of what is behind the words of these media talking heads. Their main goal is to create hype and get the small investor caught up in the moment. The reason they do that is simple, ratings! They are hosting TV shows, they need people to watch their shows. Or maybe they are selling newspapers, well, someone needs to buy the papers folks. Institutions know the role of the media all too well and use it to feed the public information for their benefit; so they can sell their shares at the highs and buy them back at the lows. For this one simple reason, you should never chase any equity. If a stock has run up on the back of media hype, run away! Learn how to utilize the charts to your advantage by reading them correctly and you will allow yourself to be a buyer when institutions are buying and a seller when they sell.Let's take a look at Microsoft's chart below and see what it is telling us regarding buying or selling the equity now:As you can see, MSFT peaked at a high of $41.66, and it is now trading just a little below that high at $40.79. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Trust recently reached a multi year high of $91.45. However, as noted by the chart above, MSFT has put in lower highs and recently made a new lower low at $38.51, before rallying back intra day to close above an important support level at $38.98.This is bearish for the equity, and perhaps a sign of distribution. If MSFT closes below $38.51 on a daily basis, it should quickly fall further. This equity should not be chased at these levels. A level that could be in play for a short term move up from is $37.18. Another level that you can keep on your buy list and will offer an opportunity for a longer term hold, will be the $35.04, depending on how and if MSFT gets there.BY Kiliam Lopez

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US5949181045,MSFT,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

(AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportOracle Corporation (ORCL): Free Stock Analysis ReportMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT): Free Stock Analysis ReportOriginal postZacks Investment Research
Stock buybacks are hitting record highs as companies with excessive amounts of cash on hand want to keep shareholders happy with short-term share appreciation. Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Oracle  (NYSE:ORCL) , and Microsoft rank amongst the largest stock repurchasers of 2019 so far.

Through the first half of the year, Apple bought back $42 billion in its shares, while Oracle repurchased $16.3 billion, and Microsoft purchased over $9 billion in its own shares. 2018 marked an all-time high for stock repurchases with a market total of over $800 billion stock buybacks.
AAPL has bought back roughly a quarter trillion dollars’ worth of its own stock over the past 5-years, while Oracle and Microsoft come in at over $70 billion in the same time frame.
These are some of the most cash rich companies in the world, but are they putting their cash to good use?
Productive Use of Money
Are share buybacks the most productive use of funds for producing long term shareholder returns? There are a few sides to this coin and they are very circumstantial. There are three things that a company can do with the cash on their balance sheet, one is let it sit in some low interest earning account, be used as commercial paper, or be put in some other fixed income vehicle. This will have very little effect on a stock price because this is what is expected from a cash pile on a company’s balance sheet.
The next thing that a company can do with extra cash is to invest in either organic developments like R&D or sales & marketing, or in a productive acquisition (full or partial). Cash used in this manner is typically the most advantageous for all stakeholders, as long as the investments have robust ROIs (return on investment). In an environment where valuations are high, acquisitions and R&D are more expensive than the projected returns. This avenue would not be the most productive use of cash.
The final use of cash that I will discuss is giving it directly back to the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This use of capital will boost short-term share prices, but will it have a long-term positive effect for shareholders? A consistent dividend is a sign that a company has matured and expects a reliable stream of income moving forward. Dividends are good for a stock stability if the firm is able to maintain its dividend yield.
Stock repurchase programs will have the same short-term stock price boost as an additional dividend, but the difference is that it is not typically consistent and will only create shareholder value if the shares bought are undervalued. Buying back stock when the intrinsic worth of the stock is below its current price will deteriorate shareholder value.
Back to Microsoft
Microsoft is trading at its all-time high right now and its forward P/E has been surging over the last 5 years as investors become more excited about Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure. Should Microsoft be buying back its own relatively expensive stock, or should the company be investing more in its cloud platform? The firm could be using the cash to further consolidate the cloud market through savvy acquisition of small cloud firms.
Like I said, high valuations make acquisitions a less attractive play and valuations in the tech industry are slightly high currently. There is only so much money that a company can poor into its R&D department before they start losing marginal value.
Though, buying stock back at all-time highs doesn’t look great for long term shareholder value, especially when its forward P/E is the highest its been in over a decade.
Take Away
I am not a big fan of companies throwing their extra cash back at the shareholders when there is still a substantial amount of growth potential. In my opinion, these tech stocks should be focusing on advancing technology and in turn humanity, instead of being worried about short-term share price boosts.
Stocks like AAPL and ORCL have shown little to no top or bottom-line growth this year but their stock price still seems to appreciate. This is primarily due to their stock buyback programs. Some of these tech companies use buybacks as merely a way to preserve their stock’s attractiveness.
There is a time and place where stock buybacks are appropriate such as when the stock price is undervalued and there are no more productive uses for the money, but this can still be speculative.

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Old Tech — MSFT — Topping?,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-old-tech-—-msft-—-topping-214903,"Jun 04, 2014",Investing.com,"As of late, all I hear is people in the media talking about the move in old tech stocks, and how new money should be put to work in names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and so on. This should make you wonder, why where the talking heads not saying this while these stocks were 10, 20 and in some cases, over 30% off their highs?At the beginning of 2013, MSFT Microsoft was trading at only $26.28. Since then, the stock has been one of the new leaders in the market, reaching a high of $41.66 earlier this year. That is an unbelievable run, especially for a company of the size of MSFT.Looking back in time, yes MSFT was a great bargain at those levels. But remember something important, back then no one wanted to buy MSFT, or so they claimed on the different media outlets. As traders and investors we must always be aware of what is behind the words of these media talking heads. Their main goal is to create hype and get the small investor caught up in the moment. The reason they do that is simple, ratings! They are hosting TV shows, they need people to watch their shows. Or maybe they are selling newspapers, well, someone needs to buy the papers folks. Institutions know the role of the media all too well and use it to feed the public information for their benefit; so they can sell their shares at the highs and buy them back at the lows. For this one simple reason, you should never chase any equity. If a stock has run up on the back of media hype, run away! Learn how to utilize the charts to your advantage by reading them correctly and you will allow yourself to be a buyer when institutions are buying and a seller when they sell.Let's take a look at Microsoft's chart below and see what it is telling us regarding buying or selling the equity now:As you can see, MSFT peaked at a high of $41.66, and it is now trading just a little below that high at $40.79. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) Trust recently reached a multi year high of $91.45. However, as noted by the chart above, MSFT has put in lower highs and recently made a new lower low at $38.51, before rallying back intra day to close above an important support level at $38.98.This is bearish for the equity, and perhaps a sign of distribution. If MSFT closes below $38.51 on a daily basis, it should quickly fall further. This equity should not be chased at these levels. A level that could be in play for a short term move up from is $37.18. Another level that you can keep on your buy list and will offer an opportunity for a longer term hold, will be the $35.04, depending on how and if MSFT gets there.BY Kiliam Lopez

US5949181045,MSFT,DeepSeek unveils new R1 open-source AI model,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/143e659f-21bb-39e8-adc7-b8d66a40dd60/deepseek-unveils-new-r1.html,Today 10:12AM,Finviz.com,"China-based AI startup DeepSeek has released an open-source version of its reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, claiming it matches OpenAI's o1 on certain AI benchmarks.
Said to challenge OpenAI's dominance in the AI sector with its competitive performance and cost-effective pricing, R1 is the firm’s latest open-source reasoning model, following a preview launch in November 2024, reportedZDNET.
DeepSeek’s R1 is made available on the Hugging Face platform under the MIT license, allowing unrestricted commercial use, reportedTechCrunch.
In a post on social mediaX, the company said that R1 beats or is on par with OpenAI's o1 in benchmarks such as AIME, MATH-500, and SWE-bench Verified.
In addition to the 671-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek has introduced six smaller ""distilled"" versions, with the smallest comprising 1.5 billion parameters, enabling operation on local devices.
Recently, researchers from University of California in Berkeley also introduced an open-source model that rivals o1-preview, achieving this milestone in just 19 hours and at a cost of approximately $450.
R1's pricing is said to be disruptive, offering API access at $0.14 per million tokens, significantly undercutting OpenAI's $7.50 rate for the same amount of data.
OpenAI currently promotes ChatGPT Pro with unlimited o1 access for $2,400 annually.
R1, however, has limitation as it must comply with China's internet regulations. This require R1’s responses to align with ""core socialist values."", reportedTechCrunch.
In a separate announcement, DeepSeek has developed a free, open-source large-language model using reduced-capability chips, H800s, from Nvidia, reportedCNBC.
The model has been developed in two months and at a cost of less than $6m.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was quoted byCNBCas saying: “To see the DeepSeek new model, it’s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient.
“We should take the developments [coming] out of China very, very seriously.”

The strategic move is set to leverage Microsoft's cloud capabilities, AI and health and life sciences expertise to speed up the detection of target and pre-clinical processes, enhancing Tevogen’s immunotherapy pipeline.
Microsoft's advanced AI tools and the Azure cloud platform will be integrated by Tevogen.AI, the AI division of Tevogen Bio, into two key objectives.
The aim is the rapid expansion of the ExacTcell Technology pre-clinical pipeline, based on the trial outcomes of TVGN 489.
By utilising machine learning for critical simulations, the company expects to accelerate the discovery of new targets through the analysis of extensive genomic datasets with enhanced speed and precision.
The partnership is set to develop algorithms for decoding interactions between human leukocyte antigens and T-cells.
This is anticipated to advance the company's understanding of immune responses and pave the way for new therapeutic opportunities.
Tevogen Bio chief information officer and Tevogen.AI head Mittul Mehta stated: “As we expand our AI efforts, this broader relationship with Microsoft represents a key milestone in our ongoing journey to revolutionise immunotherapy.
“Through deeper collaboration with Microsoft domain experts, we will further harness the power of AI to bring more precise and personalised treatments to patients at an accelerated pace.”
Tevogen Bio is also exploring human papillomavirus (HPV) treatments through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and AI tools.
A protein dataset from the HPV genome was curated by the company and is in the process of detecting cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) targets for a trial of Tevogen’s first oncology product candidate, TVGN 920.
With its ExacTcell technology, which trains CTLs to identify certain targets and then expands them, the company is poised to deliver an HPV-specific CTL treatment.
This expanded relationship with Microsoft builds ona previous partnership established in November 2024to advance the development of an HPV-specific CTL treatment.

US5949181045,MSFT,Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Is Nosediving,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-microsoft-msft-stock-nosediving-145725984.html,09:57AM,Finviz.com,"Shares of tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 7.1% in the pre-market session as stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps.
Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model ""super impressive"" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously,"" he added.
Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia—whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware.
Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Microsoft?Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
Microsoft’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 4% after President Trump announced a $500 billion Stargate project (Joint Venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank) to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri thinks players such as Nvidia would significantly benefit, likely as the supplier of critical semiconductor chips powering some of the anticipated infrastructure requirements, including data centers. As a result, it is not hard to project the anticipated gains from hyperscalers such as Oracle, Microsoft and other cloud platforms.
Overall, the deal should accelerate demand for builders and innovators within the AI space.
Also buoying the tech sector was Netflix. The company reported strong Q4 earnings results. Specifically, global streaming paid membership exceeded Wall Street expectations, with a strong net add figure (18.9 million vs. estimates of 9.8 million). This led to a revenue and EPS beat in the quarter. Additionally, revenue guidance for 2025 beat expectations, and the company spoke optimistically about multiple vectors such as ad revenue, live events, and new content. Overall, the results were impressive.
Microsoft is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $429.27 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $467.56 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Microsoft’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,646.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report ona profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

US5949181045,MSFT,"DeepSeek launch rattles tech stocks with Microsoft, Meta earnings on deck",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1d7e5b34-dd4c-381b-9547-1d5ce2fc39fd/deepseek-launch-rattles-tech.html,09:39AM,Finviz.com,"The biggest U.S. tech stocks could shed as much as $900 billion in value Monday amid a global selloff tied to the launch of an AI-powered chatbot in China that could challenge the basis of capital-spending plans and profit forecasts heading into the fourth-quarter earnings season.
DeepSeek, a China-based tech startup formed in 2023, claims that in a bit more than two months at a cost of around $6 million, it developed a large-language-model system that equals or surpasses the performance of Microsoft(MSFT)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT.
The rapid development through open-sourced collaboration, at a fraction of the cost of the $500 million-plus spent by Meta Platforms(META)Llama 3 and OpenAI's ChatGPT, has shaken the tech world and rattled investor confidence in the massive capital-spending plans of the world's biggest hyperscalers.
Microsoft, Meta, Amazon(AMZN)and Google parent Alphabet(GOOGL)are likely to spend as much as $300 billion on AI projects this year alone, with estimates for overall spending on the world's hottest technology over the next three years pegged at around $2 trillion.
The U.S. government is also moving quickly to ensure that the U.S. remains the epicenter of AI development. President Donald Trump last week unveiled a three-way joint venture of Oracle(ORCL), Japan-based SoftBank and OpenAI that he claims will invest as much as $500 billion in domestic AI infrastructure.
But with the biggest U.S. tech stocks set to update investors on their fourth-quarter profits over the next two weeks — starting Wednesday with reports from Microsoft and Meta — investors are questioning both their current market values and their massive spending plans.
""Monday's tech selloff is being driven by a fundamental catalyst, which is worries that China's DeepSeek AI tool is surpassing ChatGPT in usage and therefore requiring less complex chips from the likes of Nvidia,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, Calif.

""But the idea that this level of spending on AI may not be necessary or prudent to begin with — well, that could prove to be a fundamental game-changer"" for the broader tech sector itself, he added.
And that has major implication for the market's long bull rally, which entered its third year this month largely on the back of outsized gains in the tech space and the broader outperformance of the megacap leaders.
The Magnificent 7, in fact, are likely to contribute around a fifth of the 10.5% profit growth forecast for the S&P 500 over the three months ended in December, even as their overall earnings are set to advance at the slowest pace in nearly two years.
The collective value of the seven largest stocks, meanwhile, accounts for around a third of the S&P 500's overall market value, which explains the outsized reaction to the DeepSeek news in early Monday trading.
""U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet commanding forward price-to-earnings multiples far above historical averages,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist for Saxo Bank in Singapore.
""With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices,"" she added.
Related: Top analyst revisits Nvidia stock price target amid DeepSeek threat
Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, sees the forthcoming Mag 7 earnings slate as a ""key moment for the market, with the sector’s high valuations under scrutiny.""
""The Mag 7 accounts for about 33% of the S&P 500’s market cap and any signs of slowing growth or cautious guidance could push forward earnings multiples down from the current 21 times level,"" he said. ""A shift to 17 or 18 times earnings would imply a notable market pullback, highlighting the risk tied to this concentrated group.""
Microsoft, which earlier this month said it was on track to spend around $80 billion in its current fiscal year ""to build out AI-enabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world,"" will report fiscal-second-quarter results after the close of trading Wednesday.
Analysts are looking for overall revenue of $68.84 billion and Intelligent cloud revenue, which includes its flagship cloud offering Azure, of around $28.1 billion.
""We still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 (in the second half of the financial year] as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand,"" Microsoft's finance chief, Amy Hood, told investors in late October.

Overall revenue growth of around 11% will outpace the 6% gain expected in earnings per share, which are forecast to come in at $3.13, putting further pressures on Microsoft to monetize its massive capital spending plans.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which also is set to report December-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said last week it would spend around $65 billion this year on AI training, inferencing and broader product development.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that higher-than-expected tally a ""massive effort that will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership.""
Meta is expected to post a fourth-quarter bottom line of of $6.77 a share, up 27% from the year-earlier period, and revenue rising 17% to $47 billion.
Tesla also reports Wednesday, with investors likely to focus on CEO Elon Musk's spending plans and broader AI ambitions.
Apple will report December-quarter earnings after trading closes Thursday, while Alphabet and Amazon are set to report next week. Nvidia rounds out the Mag 7 earnings season with an update scheduled for Feb. 26.
""We do not expect big tech earnings over the next two weeks will justify the sector's elevated valuations,"" Bahnsen at Bahnsen Group said.
""These companies may very well report a wonderful quarter, and they may guide higher for intended orders and revenue expectations. Current valuations do not factor in the risks of competition, which seems inevitable, and risks of diminished order books in the future, and all the other reasons that lofty valuations eventually revert to the mean,"" he argued.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, says the market is overestimating DeepSeek's competitive threat to the U.S. tech giants. He sees the current selloff as a ""golden opportunity"" to enter the AI trade heading into 2025 and beyond.
""While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact, the reality is that Mag 7 and US tech is focused on the AGI endgame with all the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view,"" he said.
""The focus of AI right now is the enterprise use cases and broader infrastructure propelling this $2 trillion of [capital expenditures] over the next three years,"" he added.
""Next will be physical AI around robotics and autonomous. DeepSeek is not stopping it [and] to some extent it might actually accelerate capex for the hyperscalers.""

Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dropped sharply in premarket trading, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also declining. Other AI-related stocks, including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), faced significant pressure.

It's all about big tech earnings.
New developmentsfrom Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.
Nvidia stock dropped more than than 11%. Meanwhile fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more in early trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.
""When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief investment strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. ""That’s exactly what we’re seeing today.""
A slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With withindex valuations near multi-decade highsand the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.
But unlike other risks likehigher interest ratesorsticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.
In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead,causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the ""Magnificent Seven"" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.
As Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Fundamental Stock to Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-best-fundamental-125403014.html,07:54AM,Finviz.com,"We recently compiled a list of the12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now.
The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period.
In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company.
Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery.
Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.
Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility.
Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

The case, which was filed in December 2024, alleges OpenAI, an AI research company backed by Microsoft, of improperly accessing proprietary content for its ChatGPT chatbot.
The Federation of Indian Publishers, representing a coalition that includes Penguin Random House, Bloomsbury, Cambridge University Press, and Pan Macmillan, as well as Indian publishers Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co, has filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court.
The federation's legal action seeks to address concerns that OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has been using copyrighted material without permission.
Despite the allegations, OpenAI has maintained that its AI systems are designed to make fair use of publicly available data.
The Indian federation's filing in December, reviewed by Reuters, claims to have ""credible evidence/information"" that OpenAI has utilised their literary works to train ChatGPT.
The matter was initially reviewed by a court registrar in New Delhi, who, on 10 January 2025, instructed OpenAI to respond to the allegations.
The case is set to be heard by a judge on 28 January.
The Federation general secretary Pranav Gupta was cited by the news agency as saying in an interview about the lawsuit: ""Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content.
“In case they don't want to do licensing with us, they should delete datasets used in AI training and explain how we will be compensated. This impacts creativity.”
In November last year, Indian news agency ANI sued OpenAI in Delhi, accusing it of using ANI's content without permission to train ChatGPT.
However, OpenAI responded on 10 January with an 86-page filing at the Delhi High Court, addressing ANI's demand to delete its data from ChatGPT.
OpenAI has argued that complying with an order to delete training data would conflict with its US legal obligations and that Indian courts lack jurisdiction since its servers are not located in India,reported the news agency.
However, the federation contends that OpenAI's provision of services in India should subject the company to Indian copyright laws.

The company’s stock was slightly down by about 0.6% at $444.06 per share at the end of the trading day on Friday.
The tech giant is expected to report revenues of $68.9 billion for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Net income for the quarter ended in December is estimated to be $23.3 billion, while earnings per share is expected at $3.11.
In October, the company announced that its customers would be able tobuild their own autonomous agentsin Copilot Studio that can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf.” Microsoft also announced 10 new autonomous agents for its enterprise platform, Dynamics 365, designed for workers in sales, service, finance, and the supply chain — with more planned.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has joined a slew of tech companies — including its longstanding partner, OpenAI — on a$500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure projectcalled Stargate, that was announced by President Donald Trump last week. Microsoft is one of the project’s “key technology partners,” OpenAI said.
The project builds upon Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship, the startup said, adding that it plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service alongside “additional compute” from Stargate.
Microsoft said that itsnew agreementwith OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. The company is OpenAI’s largest investor, and had been itsexclusive compute provider.
“To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Perplexity AI has revised its merger offer for TikTok parent ByteDance (BDNCE), proposing a structure that could give the U.S. government up to a 50% stake in a future IPO, multiple news reports indicate. The new proposal introduces a U.S.-based holding company, NewCo, which would oversee TikTok U.S. and ByteDance's core recommendation algorithm.
Existing investors from Perplexity AI and ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. The deal's financing would involve third-party capital providers, enabling a one-time dividend payment to ByteDance investors in exchange for simplified governance. The previous offer was valued at over $50 billion, but the final amount will depend on ByteDance shareholders' participation.
Perplexity AI, a rising competitor to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reached a $9 billion valuation by late 2024 amid growing demand for generative AI. It is among several firms, including Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and potentially Elon Musk, exploring TikTok-related deals.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator usesEPS without NRIas the default for the DCF model based onresearchthat shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
As of 2025-01-27, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by theDiscounted Earnings modelis $357.97. It's currently trading at a price of $444.06. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -24.05%. The company is fair valued.
The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated byDiscounted Earningsmodel are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.

Explanation
EPS without NRI
$12.09
GuruFocus DCF calculator usesEPS without NRIas the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.
Discount Rate
11%
An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.53%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.
Growth Stage
Growth rate (g1) = 19.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10
We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.
Terminal Stage
Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10
For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.

GuruFocus also provides the calculation using thetraditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm)Free Cash Flow per Shareas a parameter, theDCF intrinsic valuebased on free cash flow is $201.89. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -119.95%. You can always switch to usingFree Cash Flow per Shareto calculate the real DCF model on ourDCF calculator page.
Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:
Future Earnings Potential:The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.
Embracing Growth:Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.
Predictability:The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.
Discount Rate:Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.
Using the GuruFocusAll-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

US5949181045,MSFT,Oxford Street suffers fresh blow as Microsoft shuts flagship store,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3150cf89-17ee-3d2b-8c2a-4e71367cd174/oxford-street-suffers-fresh.html,05:28AM,Finviz.com,"London’s Oxford Street has been dealt a fresh blow after Microsoft confirmed the closure of its flagship London store.
The US tech giant said it would be shutting its so-called experience centre in February, six years after it first opened.
Bosses said the decision to close the 21,000 sq ft store stems from the company’s push for “digital growth”, leaving Britain’s busiest shopping street with another prominent space to fill.
The three-storey store opened with great fanfare in 2019, boasting giant video walls and an Xbox gaming lounge.
A Microsoft spokesman said: “To better align with its focus on digital growth, Microsoft has decided to exit the lease at the Microsoft Experience Centre in London early.
“We regularly review our locations and our workforce to ensure we are aligning to market opportunities and make changes to meet the demands of the business.”
The closure, first reported by Windows Central, marks a fresh setback for Oxford Street.
Nike recently confirmed that it is temporarily shutting its NikeTown megastore to prepare for a “grand reopening”, while Ikea hasdelayed the launchof its new London flagship at the former Topshop store until spring.
It has also recently emerged that a clutch of fashion retailersdo not intend to renew their leases on Oxford Streetonce they expire, according to planning documents filed with Westminster City Council earlier this month.
The retailers include Zara, River Island, Urban Outfitters, Swarovski and Bershka.
Oxford Street was once the retail sector’s crown jewel but has suffered in recent years from a series of high-profile closures. This has led to an influx of American candy shops and souvenir sellers.
Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Machinpreviously described the streetas a “national embarrassment”.
However, some brands have continued to put their faith in the shopping street, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and HMV.
Abercrombie is opening a two-floor shop after closing its Regent Street site, while HMV returned to its former store near Bond Street station in 2023.
In an effort to turn its fortunes around, Sir Sadiq Khan has set out plans to pedestrianise the street as part of a £150m investment plan.
Sir Sadiq said last year: “Oxford Street was once the jewel in the crown of Britain’s retail sector, but there’s no doubt that it has suffered hugely over the last decade. Urgent action is needed to give the nation’s most famous high street a new lease of life.”
However, the Mayor of London’s plans have proved controversial with the Labour-run Westminster City Council, businesses and residents, which have raised several concerns including the project’s scope to displace traffic to nearby streets.

There's nothing wrong with those stocks, as they give investors exposure to some fantastic companies, but their high valuations could make investors hesitant about investing in funds that are so dependent on them. If there's a correction in the market, particularly in tech, those three stocks may be particularly vulnerable.
For investors who want to focus ongrowth stocksbut don't want heavy exposure to those three tech giants, one ETF you may want to consider isAmerican Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: QGRO). Here's a closer look at the fund, and why it could make for a fantastic long-term investment.
The American Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF holds 200 stocks in its portfolio, with a weighted average market cap of around $407 billion. The fund's top three holdings areNetflix,Booking Holdings, andTJX Companies. And none of those three stocks individually account for even 4% of the ETF's total weight. Its top 10 stocks, in total, represent a fairly modest 29% of American Century's total portfolio. That's great diversification for investors as it reduces the risk that one or even a few poor-performing stocks could sink the fund.
Tech stocks still play an important role in its performance, however, making up 37% of the ETF's holdings. But without heavy exposure to any individual stock, that can make American Century a much more attractive option for growth investors. You're still getting exposure to many great tech stocks, but that diversification can help reduce your overall risk. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple are all within the fund's portfolio but together, they represent just 3.8% of its total weight.
Other sectors that are key components of the ETF include consumer discretionary, which accounts for 16% of its holdings, followed by industrials at 11%, and communication services at 10% -- the last one to be in the double digits.
The American Century ETF has only been around since 2018 and so it doesn't have a long track record. But over the past five years, it has easily outperformed the S&P 500, without having to rely heavily on a select few tech stocks. That's an impressive performance and speaks to the quality of the growth stocks it contains in its portfolio.
The fund has anexpense ratioof 0.29%, which is a bit higher than other ETFs, but it's still fairly low overall. And I believe it's justifiable given the more balanced growth option it provides investors.
As well as the fund has performed of late, American Century can potentially remain a market-beating ETF in the years ahead due to its diversification. Its safer mix of growth stocks can position investors to benefit from the market's long-term gains without having to worry about a few stocks that could derail its performance.
For investors who want a fund that isn't as dependent on the three most valuable stocks in the world, this ETF can be a great option to add to your portfolio right now and hang on to for the long haul.

In a Facebook post, Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said: ""This will be a defining year for AI. This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business.""
With this investment, the company aims to strengthen its position against competitors OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon and Google in the AI technology race.
As part of this investment, Meta intends to increase hiring for AI roles and construct a 2GW data centre, which would large enough to accommodate a considerable portion of Manhattan.
The company plans to conclude 2025 with more than 1.3 million graphics processor units (GPUs), which are critical for powering AI workloads, and aims to bring about 1GW of computing power online in 2025.
Meta is one of the leading GPU purchasers from Nvidia, whose chips are essential for powering advanced AI models.
The announcement follows significant investments by other technology companies in AI infrastructure, following the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
Meta’s announcement follows closely on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle will joinforces to launch a venturecalled Stargate, with plans to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure across the country.
Earlier tin January 2025, Microsoft announcedplans to invest approximately $80bnin 2025 for data centre expansion, while Amazon stated that its 2025 spending would surpass an estimated $75bn in 2024.
Meta has positioned itself as a key contender in the AI landscape, driven by innovations such as its AI chatbot, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and open-source strategy. This approach sets Meta apart from its competitors by offering its Llama AI models free of charge to consumers and businesses alike, reportedReuters.
Zuckerberg anticipates that Meta's AI assistant will serve more than 1 billion people in 2025, up from approximately 600 million monthly active users in 2024. Meta Platforms has announced plans to invest up to $65bn this year to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.

The new business structure will enable ByteDance to control a minority stake in TikTok as their child company. Through its agreement with Oracle, the parent company retained lower-level control of TikTok platform infrastructure, including management of algorithms and data systems, while Oracle handled software maintenance to reduce Chinese oversight.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with ORCL.
The server networks which support TikTok operate through Oracle's existing infrastructure responsibilities. The deal's success would grant Oracle access to perform direct oversight of TikTok's data processing and content control methods while the administration tackles data protection issues linked to Chinese ownership.
Microsoft participates in ongoing discussions following its failed 2020 attempt to buy TikTok's partnership with Oracle and Walmart. MethodManager has mutually excluded Walmart from its current dealmaking discussions on TikTok assortment values.
The negotiations occur at a time when TikTok continues to face meaningful questions about its data handling methods. The US Government has identified major risks that ByteDance may use to share TikTok user data with the Chinese federal authorities. TikTok continues to encounter worldwide difficulties, including an entire Indian market ban and privacy protection suits targeting children.
The negotiations occur during a 75-day temporary period granted in an executive order that protects ByteDance from any TikTok divestiture-related enforcement actions coordinated by the Trump administration.
The ongoing discussions about one of the world's favourite social media applications show rising pressure to find solutions for its regulatory problems despite a nebulous end result.

We recently compiled a list of the10 Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other cloud stocks.
Based on a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud industry in 2025 is projected to grow by 15.1% to $1,256.8 billion. While 2024 was marked by high adoption by the BFSI sector, the year ahead should see applications being developed that meet the unique specifications of each industry. North America and Europe should capture the bulk of the market size but APAC is expected to register the fastest growth. The integration of AI with cloud platforms accompanied by new service models is another key development expected to shape this industry.
Cloud ETFs have generated generous returns of 2.74%, 28.54% and 11.00% for 1-month, 6-month and 1-year tenors. One would assume that the underlying stocks would continue to perform well, propelled by strong industrial tailwinds.

US5949181045,MSFT,"One Analyst Firm Just Ranked Nvidia and Alphabet as Its Top 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks for 2025. Are Both Stocks Buys?",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cbfee956-79a8-3359-9850-f388417cc6d6/one-analyst-firm-just-ranked.html,08:30PM,Finviz.com,"Analysts atJefferiesrecently ranked the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks based on which ones they thought would outperform in 2025. The name refers to a group of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have been helping lead the market higher the past couple of years.
Its top picks among the group wereNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) andAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The group also includes, by order of Jefferies' rankings,Meta Platforms,Apple,Amazon,Tesla, andMicrosoft.
The firm's rankings were based on several quantitative measures, including growth, valuation, yield, earnings revisions, sell-side analyst sentiment, return on invested capital (ROIC), stock price momentum, and research and development (R&D) versuscapex(capital expenditures) spending.
Nvidia grabbed the top spot largely due to its strong growth, upward guidance revisions, attractive valuation, and strong analyst sentiment.
Let's look at why I think both Nvidia and Alphabet stocks are attractive buys.
Nvidia remains a great combination of incredibly strong growth at an attractive valuation. The company is on pace to report its second consecutive year of triple-digit revenue increases, which given its size is quite remarkable.
Meanwhile, analysts are projecting more than 50% sales growth in 2025. And it is attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) below 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 1. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, although growth stocks will often have PEGs well above 1.
Nvidia's growth comes from a combination of the frantic buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games, have become the backbone of AI infrastructure given their superior processing speeds.
As large tech companies and AI start-ups rush to improve their AI models, they need more and more computing power to train them, which is largely coming from GPUs. Through Nvidia's CUDA X collection of libraries, tools, and microservices, its semiconductors are easily programmable for various AI tasks, which has allowed it to take a nearly 90% market share in the GPU space.
Elon Musk's xAI is a great example of the growing use of GPUs in AI model training. The company used 20,000 GPUs to train its Grok 2 model, while it originally was using 100,000 GPUs to train its Grok 3 model, but then increased it to 200,000 for phase two of its training. Meanwhile, Musk has talked about xAI's data center hosting a 1 million GPU cluster in the future.
Meanwhile, Nvidia's largest customer, Microsoft, announced it will spend $80 billion on AI data centers this year. Not to be outdone, a consortium consisting ofOracle,SoftBank Group, and OpenAI has discussed spending up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in Texas as part of the recently announced Project Stargate.
A lot of this spending will undoubtedly go toward GPUs. These projects demonstrate the type of growth still ahead for Nvidia.
While no mega-cap company can come close to matching Nvidia's recent growth, Alphabet is a strong growing company that has the cheapest valuation among the Magnificent Seven with a forward P/E of only 19.4.
Last quarter, Alphabet grew its revenue a solid 15%, while its profits soared 34% and its earnings per share climbed 37%. The growth was led by its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which grew its revenue by 35%.
Cloud computing is a business with very high fixed costs that has a lot of operating leverage once the business reaches scale. That was seen in its last quarter, when the segment saw a profitability inflection point, with segment operating income surging from $266 million a year ago to $1.95 billion.
With organizations scampering to build out their own AI models and applications, expect this business to continue to grow strongly as Alphabet adds more data center capacity. Meanwhile, the company could see even more operating leverage as it has developed its own custom AI chips with the help ofBroadcom, which it has said in combination with GPUs is helping reduce AI inference processing times and lowering costs.
As it continues to scale up as the smallest of the big-three cloud computing companies and with its custom chip advantage, Google Cloud's margins should continue to improve, leading to strong earnings growth.
At the same time, Alphabet owns the world's dominant search engine in Google and YouTube, the most viewed streaming platform globally. These businesses continue to grow revenue by double digits, with sales for its overall Google Services segment climbing 13% last quarter. Segment operating income soared 29% to $30.9 billion.
The company is looking to incorporate its new Gemini AI model throughout its businesses this year to help drive growth, while also looking to promote its Gemini app, which is its answer to ChatGPT.
Management also has other emerging businesses that it is investing in, including quantum computing, where it recently announced a big technological breakthrough. It also owns Waymo, which is currently the only company offering paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. These are presently money-losing business, but they have big potential.
Overall, Alphabet is a nice combination of growth and value with some solid longer-term optionality with its investments in robotaxis and quantum computing.

Bill Gates thinks another pandemic is entirely possible, and the world is not as prepared as it should be.
In an interview with theWall Street Journal, the philanthropist was asked what keeps him up at night.
“The chance of a natural pandemic in the next four years is somewhere between 10 and 15%,” Gates replied. “And it’d be nice to think we’re actually more ready for that than we were last time, but so far we’re not.”
Challenged on that statement, the Microsoft cofounder reiterated himself saying, “we’re absolutely not.”
“People — rather than having a consensus about what tools are missing — are mostly still replaying the various mistakes that were made,” Gates added. “I wouldn’t say that we’re as far along as you’d expect after trillions of dollars and millions of lives have been lost.”
Through the Gates Foundation, the billionaire has been warning about climate concerns, cyberattacks, and public health needs, while also pushing for solutions.
In September, he said global unrest could spark a major war and thatanother pandemic was likely in the next 25 years.
In 2022, Gates authored the bookHow to Prevent the Next Pandemicand voiced his concerns around the lack of planning with governments across the world, including the U.S., in the handling of the 2020 pandemic.
He also called for stronger quarantining policies, investing in disease monitoring, as well as increased vaccine research and development. Additionally, the Gates Foundation pledged up to $125 million in the U.S. to “help end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.”

We recently published an article titledJim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump’s $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it’s different from the previous one. Cramer shared, “If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.” According to him, “These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation” to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.
Commenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, “Now, by the way, there’s a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?” This means wondering where he is “in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.” Cramer believes that Musk “doesn’t seem to have them” and added, “If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don’t want a seat at the table, I want a table.”
The CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to “forget healthcare.” He believes “Healthcare’s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it’s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there’s a call center that’s better.”
Cramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, “Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there’s a lot more room.” Cramer believes “there’s a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that’s coming on.” He doesn’t like small-cap stocks either. “And I’m not a small cap aficionado,” Cramer commented. He believes, “That stuff doesn’t work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.” The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes “companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn’t think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven’t done anything lately.”
As for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:
“The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That’s where the President’s going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.”
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. It was one of the first major players in the AI industry, courtesy of its partnership with OpenAI. However, President Trump’s $500 billion Stargate announcement, which also included Oracle, led Cramer to speculate that perhaps the team-up between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI is entering a new phase, so to speak. He also commented on industry views that the firm’s CoPilot AI software isn’t gaining popularity. Here are Cramer’s full remarks:
“Initially, you see these things and you think well it’s for show. . . and then you step back and you say now wait a second, OpenAI is the partner here. You see Sam Altman up there. And you think well wait a second. I thought he was Microsoft’s guy. And then he’s not.
“If true it appears that Oracle might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary.
“On Microsoft there was very key note from Morgan Stanley. Cutting price target but still saying it’s good. I’m staying on that one. I’m questioning, how good Microsoft is because ever since Benioff did this, with that clippy two thing, he’s out there he’s slamming it everywhere. I’m worried about it.”
Overall MSFTranks 1ston our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US5949181045,MSFT,From Farmland To Fusion  Bill Gates' Vision For Clean Energy Takes Shape In Wyoming,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farmland-fusion-bill-gates-vision-143041211.html,09:30AM,Finviz.com,"Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
Microsoft cofounder and America's largestprivate farmland owner Bill Gatesranks 43rd on the 2025 Land Report 100 with 275,000 acres, but his influence extends far beyond agriculture.
In June 2024, Gates made headlines by breaking ground on what he described as ""the most advanced nuclear facility in the world."" Situated on 44 acres inKemmerer, Wyoming, the TerraPower Natrium reactor represents a significant leap in nuclear innovation, according to the Land Report.
Gates highlighted the reactor's sodium-cooled design on his Gates Notes blog, stating it ""will bring safe, next-generation nuclear technology to life in Wyoming. It's a huge milestone for the local economy, America's energy independence and the fight against climate change.""

Nuclear energy advocates emphasize that modern advancements have significantly reduced risks associated with meltdowns, such as the Three Mile Island incident. Instead, the new technologies promise a clean and sustainable energy source that could play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change.
Gates, a longtime proponent of nuclear energy, traces his commitment to a scientific paper he read nearly two decades ago outlining the transformative potential of Natrium reactor technology.
""The design was far safer than any existing plant, with the temperatures held under control by the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes,"" Gates wrote on his blog. ""It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night.

""As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it – and revolutionize how we generate power in the U.S. and around the world.""
Gates founded TerraPower in 2008, inspired by the groundbreaking scientific report he had read a few years earlier. The company's innovative theories and designs took a significant step toward becoming reality in 2024 when the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted TerraPower's construction permit application for review.
""This step may sound bureaucratic but is, in fact, a huge deal and the first time something like this has happened with a commercial nonlight water reactor in more than 40 years,"" Gates wrote.

He elaborated that the NRC review process, which is expected to take a couple of years, is critical for moving forward. Once approved, construction on the actual nuclear reactor can begin.
Meanwhile, TerraPower will continue building the nonnuclear components of the facility.
""Construction will begin (in 2025) on the so-called ‘energy island,' which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit,"" Gates wrote. ""The plant hopefully will come online in 2030.""

US5949181045,MSFT,2 Soaring Stocks to Own for the Next 20 Years,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e27041c1-048a-3701-b8f2-2647aa5ed0e3/2-soaring-stocks-to-own-for.html,09:25AM,Finviz.com,"Thinking long term remains one of the best mindsets for investing in stocks. To that end, choosing companies that are well positioned within their respective industries is essential. Furthermore, it makes sense to look at industries that will likely be in strong demand over the long run. Overall, I like tech and groceries.
Technology is an ever essential part of today's living, and isn't going anywhere. The other business that isn't going anywhere is food. Groceries and retail in general aren't something that's going to disappear. Because of the demand for these two areas, I've chosen two essential stocks that will likely remain strong over the next few decades.
Over the long term, it's hard to go wrong withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Gaming, AI, the cloud -- there are multiple avenues where Microsoft can continue to develop its offerings, and the success is present in its five-year return of roughly 160%. An added bonus here is that Microsoft shares are much more fairly valued than others, such asNvidia.
Microsoft finished fiscal 2024 with revenue up 16%, operating income up 24%, and net income up 22%. Between fiscal 2020 and 2024, revenue grew from $143 billion to $245 billion.
Fiscal 2025 looks to be continuing the trend of solid growth across multiple avenues in the business. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2024), revenue increased 16% year over year to $65.6 billion, along with an 11% increase in net income.
What I like about Microsoft is the breadth of its product lineup. Its finances are procured over a multitude of business segments including Microsoft Cloud, AI, Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, servers and corresponding products, Windows OEM, revenue from search and advertising, along with the classic Xbox console and corresponding services, which saw their sales increase a whopping 61%.
Over the last several quarters, Microsoft had a tendency to surprise to the upside on earnings, but analyst estimates are calling for 2025 earnings of $13.09, which would give the stock a forward P/E ratio of just under 33 times earnings. When you consider some of the high premiums that tech stocks are going for, this seems pretty reasonable given Microsoft's positioning within all of these different business segments.
That's right! It might not be flashy, butWalmart(NYSE: WMT)continues to be a steady performer over time. Sure it might have an off quarter every now and then, but over the long haul the retailer delivers for shareholders. According to YCharts, it was the second best performing Dow Jones Industrial stock in 2024, gaining just under 72%, and its diversified approach to delivering goods to consumers makes me think it will still be crushing it in 20 years.
Walmart is up163%over the last five years, roughly doubling theS&P 500. It has done this by continuing its traditional brick-and-mortar business, while creating online options that complement, rather than work against its traditional approach. Whether you want to buy in the store, order online and pick it up, or have it delivered, Walmart has something going.
Through Q3 of fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 31, 2024), Walmart has been doing well. Total revenue was up 5.4% to $500.43 billion through the first nine fiscal months of the year, while earnings per share jumped 41.1% to $1.75 per diluted share. Analyst estimates are calling for $2.48 per share in fiscal 2025, giving Walmart aforward P/E ratioof 37 times earnings. The company's guidance for fiscal 2025 is calling for similar adjusted earnings of $2.42 to $2.47.
I'm a firm believer that no one form of retail will dominate over time, and rather that a diversified business is what customers are after. Walmart's large spread of physical stores are the envy of many, and set it up to be able to quickly supply goods via delivery and order/pickup. This setup positions Walmart perfectly for continuing to dominate retail over the coming years, and leads me to believe it continues to be a strong stock to own for the long term.

US5949181045,MSFT,"Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-a-key-fed-meeting-and-trumps-first-full-week-in-office-what-to-know-this-week-123505201.html,07:35AM,Finviz.com,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.
The week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.
Earnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 — highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) — are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.
Last week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.
Markets welcomed Trump's initial days in office aslimited news on tariffssteadied investors and a massiveAI investment announcementhelpedboost tech stocks.
Four trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new presidentis in the driver's seat of the stock market.
On Tuesday,marketsrallied as the dollarfellafter Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.
Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.
""The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,"" Chronert said. ""Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.""
On Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announceda new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed ""Stargate""to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.
Oracle and SoftBank — along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) — rallied on the news.
In week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.
With a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.
Data from theCME Group showsmarkets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.
This past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd ""demand that interest rates drop immediately."" These commentsstirred discussionabout a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.
Even so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. ""Powell’s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,"" Feroli wrote.
""For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday""
Several key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.
On Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.
Friday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in December,unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.
RBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week — combined with Trump's policies — could leave the Fed ""playing third fiddle"" in markets.
Gwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could ""quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week’s press conference.""
S&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.
But much of that growth still relies on the performance of the""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks. And four of those companies — Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — will report in the week ahead.
This group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.
As the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists tocall for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.
Though as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""
Notably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.

US5949181045,MSFT,Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/217ee2ac-a4cb-3146-ba6a-3bf8ca1c84a6/where-will-nvidia-stock-be-in.html,04:00AM,Finviz.com,"I recently calculated how much it would have taken to become a millionaire by investing inNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)stock 10 years ago. The answer was a shockingly low $3,625 at the time I crunched the numbers. Because Nvidia's shares have risen over the last few days, the magic amount is even lower now.
In my backward-looking exercise, I also examined what signs might have pointed to Nvidia's potential for massive gains. And there were some good indications about the company's prospects for anyone looking closely.
But what about Nvidia's prospects now? Where will the company and its stock be in 10 years? I won't pretend to have any definitive answers. However, I'll take a stab at where I think Nvidia will be in 2035.
The most important assumption I have about Nvidia's future is that we've only seen the tip of the iceberg with how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world. I suspect more of the iceberg will be visible relatively soon, though, with the adoption of AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously.
Couldartificial general intelligence (AGI)be achieved within the next 10 years? Probably, depending on how you define AGI. I agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that AI models will be able to pass any test that humans can in five years or less. I wouldn't go as far as predicting AI systems will be sentient (a criterion some have for AGI) by 2035, though.
I fully expect Nvidia to remain a central player in AI over the next decade and beyond. The company's new BlackwellGPUarchitecture -- which has the most powerful AI capabilities to date -- will likely seem painfully slow and unwieldy compared to what Nvidia will roll out 10 years from now.
My future picture of Nvidia includes the company aggressively expanding into areas such as developing custom AI chips. I also think the autonomous ride-hailing market (robotaxis) will explode over the next few years, with Nvidia as one of the top beneficiaries.
While AI is Nvidia's biggest opportunity, in my opinion, I believe the company will also see tremendous growth thanks to the adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). AR and VR applications will require powerful graphics processors -- and no company is better at it than Nvidia.
Murphy's Law can affect even the best companies. What could go wrong and derail my admittedly upbeat prediction about Nvidia's future? Several things.
Competition in the AI chip market will almost certainly increase significantly over the next 10 years. I expectAdvanced Micro Deviceswill further step up its game. I'll also keep my eyes on Nvidia's big customers who have developed their own AI chips, including Google parentAlphabet,Amazon, andMicrosoft.
Perhaps the most worrisome competition, though, could come from major technological breakthroughs by rivals. Nvidia's Huang caused quantum computing stocks to plunge recently with his comments that practical quantum computers are probably 15 to 30 years away. That could be wishful thinking. I can envision a scenario where another company develops a quantum computer that's more powerful for training and deploying AI models than Nvidia's GPUs.
As successful as it is (and I think will continue to be), Nvidia isn't immune to macroeconomic factors. If the global economy enters into a deep, prolonged recession, the chipmaker might not grow nearly as much as I expect it will.
I'd also be remiss without acknowledging that my optimism about the future of AI could be too pie in the sky. Maybe large language models (LLMs) could hit a performance plateau, with no better technologies emerging.
So far, I've only addressed where I think Nvidia's business will be in 2035. But the multitrillion-dollar question is: Where will Nvidia stock be in 10 years?
Before I attempt to answer this question, I'll tell you what Idon'tthink will happen. Over the last 10 years, Nvidia's share price has skyrocketed nearly 285 times higher. I don't see the stock delivering anywhere near that kind of return over the next decade.
However, as mentioned, I foresee major growth opportunities for Nvidia over the next 10 years in AI, robotaxis, and AR/VR. Could Nvidia's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) be at least 15% during this period? I think it's possible. If we assume a 15% CAGR, the stock would be a four-bagger by 2035, with a market cap of over $18 trillion.
Admittedly, this prediction could be way too optimistic. But even if Nvidia delivers a much lower CAGR of 8%, its stock would more than double over the next decade and give the company a market cap of more than $11 trillion. Unless an unforeseen threat emerges that takes the wind out of Nvidia's sails, the GPU maker's future appears to be very bright.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $369,816!*
Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $42,191!*
Netflix:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004,you’d have $527,206!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

US5949181045,MSFT,'What Harm Is Done If They Leave?'  Microsoft's Secret Document Reveals AI Retention Strategies,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harm-done-leave-microsofts-secret-233017678.html,Jan-25-25 06:30PM,Finviz.com,"Microsoft has a new way to determine which employees it can't afford to lose and it'sall about AI.An internal document viewed byBusiness Insidersheds light on how managers are working to keep top AI talent in the fold – and it involves some big questions and even bigger paychecks.
Here's what's going on.
AI Talent Gets Special Treatment
Microsoft managers can request retention bonuses for employees they see as irreplaceable. To do that, they fill out a form answering questions like, ""What harm is done if the employee leaves Microsoft?""

Sounds intense, right? But there's a twist. The document now includes a new section specifically about AI.
Managers are asked to explain whether the employee is a ""critical AI talent"" and how their departure could hurt the company'sAI initiatives.It's clear that AI is Microsoft's top priority and they're not messing around when it comes to keeping the best and brightest.
Why the Focus on AI?
AI is the name of the game right now. Companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta are racing to dominate the space and the talent competition is fierce.
It's not just about snagging the brightest minds – it's about keeping them. Losing an engineer who knows the ins and outs of AI could mean setbacks worth millions.

Microsoft seems to know this. According toBI, Microsoft's AI employees earn much more than their colleagues. Engineers in the AI group reportedly make 48% more than the average software engineer at the company.
A Strategic Move
The updated retention form was prepared for a specific group inside Microsoft, though it's unclear if the same AI-focused questions are being used across the company.
A Microsoft spokesperson toldBIthat these forms aren't standardized. Different teams can tweak them based on what matters most to their work.
But the inclusion of AI in this document hints at a larger trend. The stakes in the AI talent wars are sky-high and Microsoft isn't about to lose its edge.

The Bigger Picture
This move comes as AI reshapes the tech world. From generative AI tools to advanced models, the industry is evolving fast. And companies like Microsoft are betting big.
The takeaway? If you're an AI expert, you're in demand. If you're not, maybe it's time to improve your machine learning skills.

US5949181045,MSFT,President Donald Trump Just Announced Project Stargate: 3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Profit From the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Buildout,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1ae6ad22-62ac-304d-9287-d5ce64c1d7e6/president-donald-trump-just.html,06:02PM,Finviz.com,"Among the biggest market drivers over the past couple of years have been the developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. In simplest terms, AI's advanced algorithms can be deployed to streamline and automate many time-consuming tasks, freeing up people for higher-level work. As a result, many believe thatgenerative AIwill spark a wave of productivity growth, creating windfall profits for the companies that make the best use of this cutting-edge technology.
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced an initiative dubbed Project Stargate, which he said will be the ""largest AI infrastructure project in history."" The private joint venture will initially be funded bySoftBank, OpenAI,Oracle, and AI-focused investment fund MGX, and ""intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building AI infrastructure,"" according to the press release. The initiative plans to build as many as 20 immense data centers across the country designed to meet the processing power needs of AI systems.
The announcement also revealed the identities of several companies that will be tapped to provide the necessary technology. Let's look at three that stand to profit from this sizable infrastructure investment.
It shouldn't be any surprise thatNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)was selected as one of Project Stargate's ""key initial technology partners."" The company pioneered thegraphics processing units (GPUs)that have become the staple providers of the specific types of computing horsepower that AI requires.
Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing -- most of which takes place in data centers. As a result, the company dominates the niche, controlling 98% of the market in 2023, similar to its market share in 2022. While the figures for 2024 have yet to be collated, industry watchers expect to learn that Nvidia retained an industry-leading share of the data center GPU market.
There have been concerns among some investors that Nvidia's growth may have peaked, but the Stargate project's scope helps illustrate the long runway ahead of it. In fact, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes surmises the chipmaker could be the biggest single beneficiary of Project Stargate, as ""well over $100 billion"" of its budget could go to Nvidia.
Trading at just 33 times next year's expected earnings, Nvidia is attractively priced in light of its ongoing opportunities.
OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has a long-standing relationship withMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), so it makes sense the company would be tapped as a supplier. The press release noted that the initiative ""builds on the existing OpenAI partnership with Microsoft"" and that the company would continue to ""increase its consumption of Azure,"" Microsoft's cloud infrastructure service.
Microsoft has made it crystal clear that demand for AI is driving its cloud growth. CEO Satya Nadella noted that in its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended Sept. 30), Azure Cloud took share from its rivals, growing 34% year over year, compared to the industry's 24% growth rate. Nadella also noted that 12 percentage points of that growth was the result of demand for AI-related services. Perhaps more importantly, he pointed out that ""demand continues to be higher than our available capacity.""
The company has already taken steps to address that imbalance. In a blog post earlier this month, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith noted the company is on track to invest $80 billion in data centers ""to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.""
The company was quick off the blocks to provide AI solutions, giving it a head start that's now paying off. The combination of unrelenting demand for AI and Microsoft's leadership position in the space suggests that the best is likely yet to come.
Microsoft stock currently trades for 34 times next year's expected earnings, a reasonable valuation given its place in the AI ecosystem.
Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM)also has a lot to gain from the Stargate project, thanks largely to its close ties to Nvidia and its contributions to its AI-centric chips. In an interview this week, CEO Rene Haas said, ""It's a big, big, deal.""
While Nvidia has begun shipping its new Blackwell processors, a look at its previous top-of-the-line Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip can help provide context. The GH200 combines CPU and GPU technology on the same processor to meet the rigorous demands of AI. It incorporates two Grace CPUs, each of which contains 72 Arm V9 cores, for a total of 144 CPU cores contained in each chip. Reports suggest the BlackwellGB200platform contains the same number of these high-end cores, which bodes well for Arm.
In an interview last year, CEO Rene Haas noted that many of Arm's customers were shifting to the V9 and using more of these cores per device. That's important, because the royalty rate for the V9 is twice that of its predecessor, which suggests Arm's sales growth will continue to accelerate.
Arm's rapid growth has been accompanied by a commensurate increase in its valuation, though the most commonly used metrics fall short in assessing high-growth stocks. Using the more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, Arm's valuation clocks in at 0.24. Any stock with a positive number less than 1 for that metric is generally viewed as being undervalued.

US5949181045,MSFT,Bill Gates reveals he probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum if he were growing up today,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5190fa9d-5176-3d2c-a07d-827110d11208/bill-gates-reveals-he.html,12:56PM,Finviz.com,"In an upcoming memoir fromMicrosoftcofounder Bill Gates, the tech billionaire recalls his childhood and the support he received from his parents, who ""struggled with their complicated son"" but helped nurture his uniqueness.
Microsoft cofounder and philanthropist Bill Gates suggested he may be neurodivergent and speculated that he likely would've been diagnosed that way as a kid.
In his upcoming memoirSource Code: My Beginnings, an excerpt of which was published in theWall Street Journal, the tech billionaire recalled his childhood in Washington state and the support he received from his parents, who ""struggled with their complicated son.""
""If I were growing up today, I probably would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum. During my childhood, the fact that some people's brains process information differently from others wasn't widely understood,"" Gates wrote, noting that the term ""neurodivergent"" would be coined in the 1990s.
""My parents had no guideposts or textbooks to help them grasp why their son became so obsessed with certain projects, missed social cues and could be rude and inappropriate without seeming to notice his effect on others.""
He added that his parents—Bill and Mary Gates—offered a mix of support and pressure, allowing him to grow emotionally while also nudging him to engage with others by having him play on a baseball team and join the Cub Scouts. In addition, exposing him to their adult friends and colleagues ""fed my curiosity about the world beyond school.""
Still, Gates acknowledged that his social side developed slowly, but it eventually happened as he got older, gained more experience, and had kids.
While his success as a tech entrepreneur is now legendary, he attributed much of it to luck. For example, Gates said the biggest part of his good fortune was being born to his parents.
He also benefited from favorable timing as his childhood and formative years coincided with the computer revolution. And then there's the ""unearned privilege"" he enjoyed.
""To be born in the rich U.S. is a big part of a winning birth-lottery ticket, as is being born white and male in a society that advantages white men,"" Gates wrote.
That echoes Warren Buffett'slettertoBerkshire Hathawayshareholders in November, when the investing iconmused on his luck, saying his male status gave him confidence that he could become rich.
“As I write this, I continue my lucky streak that began in 1930 with my birth in the United States as a white male,” he wrote.
Meanwhile, other business leaders, includingTeslaCEO Elon Musk and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, have credited much of their career success to neurodivergence.
In 2021, while hostingSaturday Night Live, Musk said he has Asperger's syndrome.
""I don't always have a lot of intonation or variation in how I speak... which I'm told makes for great comedy,"" he joked in his opening monologue. ""I'm actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger's to host SNL.""

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI news and ratings.
According to a CNBC report, China-based AI lab DeepSeek has sparked concern in Silicon Valley by releasing AI models that outperform leading U.S. systems despite using cheaper methods and less-powerful Nvidia H800 chips. In December 2024, DeepSeek launched a free open-source model developed in two months for under $6 million, which surpassed Meta’s Llama 3.1, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in benchmark tests. Its latest model, r1, also outperformed OpenAI’s o1 in reasoning tasks, the report states.
DeepSeek’s advancements, achieved despite U.S. semiconductor restrictions, raise questions about America’s AI dominance and the efficiency of large-scale AI investments. Experts attribute their success to techniques like distillation, which optimize smaller models using larger ones, as per CNBC.

As China challenges US dominance, the new US President, Donald Trump is also making announcements to keep the US as the global AI leader. Apart from the announcement of the $500 billion Stargate Project, President Trump also signed an executive order aimed at removing AI-related policies introduced during the Biden Administration, which he claims restricted innovation through excessive government control.
The new order repeals Biden’s AI regulations and instructs agencies to revise policies that may hinder AI advancements. It also emphasizes the need for the U.S. to maintain global leadership in AI, focusing on national security, economic growth, and unbiased AI development. The order includes creating an AI Action Plan and revising federal AI governance guidelines.  It builds on the president’s previous initiatives, such as increasing AI research funding, establishing AI research institutes, and issuing guidance for AI standards and federal adoption.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.

US5949181045,MSFT,2 ETFs to Buy in 2025 and Hold Forever,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7e4311a5-e655-36b1-8128-dcd792634352/2-etfs-to-buy-in-2025-and.html,09:45AM,Finviz.com,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been around for about three decades, but they've grown in popularity in recent years. They trade on the market, so they're much easier to invest in than traditional mutual funds, and they often come with low expense ratios instead of high management fees.
Vanguard is one of the top names inETFs. All of its ETFs track an index, so they're passively managed and come with some of the lowest fees you can find. TheVanguard S&P500ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO)and theVanguard S&P 500 GrowthETF(NYSEMKT: VOOG)are two excellent ETFs to invest in today. They offer value right now and for the long term.
Each one is a solid investment on its own, but they also complement each other. Let's take a closer look at both.
It's a well-known aphorism that it's hard to beat the market. To add another cliche, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That's where investing in an index fund that tracks theS&P 500comes in.
Many investors know aboutS&P Global's SPIVA scorecard, which measures how large-cap equity funds fare versus the S&P 500. The most recent data, for the first half of 2024, shows that 57% of these funds underperformed. That's not unusual.
If you believe in the U.S. economy, it makes a lot of sense toinvest in the S&P 500, which is a selection of the top 500 stocks in the country. Even Warren Buffett, who has beaten the market by a wide margin over time, recommends investing in this type of index fund.Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company, owns two different ETFs that track the index, although they make up a small percentage of the company's portfolio.
The S&P 500 changes every so often, switching out companies that don't meet its market capitalization threshold. Investing in this kind of instrument gives you the passive power of getting exposure to the best stocks without having to pick them yourself.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a great choice because it comes with the Vanguard name, and Vanguard has a long track record that leads to trust. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.03%, as compared to 0.77% for similar ETFs.
The S&P 500 is up 27% over the past year, and investing in this ETF is a no-brainer way to unlock the value of investing in the broader market.
The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF takes the invest-in-the-market concept up a notch. Instead of the full scale of stocks in the S&P 500, this ETF invests in theS&P 500 Growth Index, which is about 200 stocks. That's still a good amount of diversification, but in terms of growth, it's the cream of the crop.
That has led to strong results over time, andthe Growth ETFhas outperformed the regular ETF in both the short term and the long term. It's up 38% over the past year, and that translates into an even wider margin since the ETFs were created.
If you'd invested $10,000 in each of them 10 years ago, you'd have $6,880 more today from the Growth ETF. It still has the same trusted name and low fees as the regular Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, with an expense ratio of 0.1% versus 0.94% for similar ETFs.
There is more risk since there are fewer stocks, and it's growth-focused. That could work against you when the market prizes value over growth. But this isn't an ETF full of new, risky stocks. It's still anchored by the large, established companies that feature high up in the S&P 500, likeApple,Microsoft, andNvidia.
If I had to choose one of these Vanguard ETFs, I'd choose the S&P 500 Growth ETF. But if you can invest in both, you're getting even more security while putting the growth ETF to work for your money.

US5949181045,MSFT,"This Is the Most Promising Quantum Computing Stock, but Should You Buy It Right Now?",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cef49656-6513-3c55-b69c-74014b32f274/this-is-the-most-promising.html,08:30AM,Finviz.com,"Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate how companies and scientists process data, which could lead to more advanced artificial intelligence, better weather predictions, and medical breakthroughs.
The long-term potential forquantum computing stocksis significant, and McKinsey estimates the market could reach up to $2 trillion by 2035.
Competition is already heating up, with many companies taking a unique approach to developing their quantum computers. One such company isIonQ(NYSE: IONQ), a leading manufacturer of quantum computing systems. But is the stock a buy right now? Let's take a closer look.
One thing that makes IonQ unique is its quantum computer creation method. Instead of using more traditional quantum computers that include ""loops of supercooled superconducting wire or intentional imperfections crystalline silicon,"" IonQ uses trapped ions instead.
The company says the trapped ions can be used to create a linear chain of ions that can be used for quantum processors with the potential for 100+ qubits (the unit of processing measurement for quantum computers). The result is a high-powered quantum computer with the potential for far fewer errors than the competition.
One of the biggest hurdles for quantum computing is using it for practical purposes. However, IonQ is already growing its customer list, with the automakerHyundai, industrial equipment companyCaterpillar, and the U.S. military as customers.
IonQ's management said in the recent quarterly earnings call that biopharmaceutical drug discovery and computer-aided simulations for the engineering and manufacturing industries are two of the company's primary focuses for practical quantum computing applications. The company recently tapped into some of this market potential by announcing a new partnership withAstraZenecato speed up innovation in biopharmaceuticals.
IonQ also offers access to some of its quantum computing via public cloud networks, includingMicrosoft,Amazon, andAlphabet's Google. These partnerships could help further practical uses of its quantum computer processing as demand grows.
Even with its significant potential in quantum computing, I don't think IonQ's stock is a buy right now for most investors.
First, quantum computing is highly speculative. Sure, there are some practical applications, but investing in this technology is essentially a bet that quantum computing will one day significantly change how companies process information. It's an unproven market, and trying to pick a winner so early seems nearly impossible.
Second, and perhaps most importantly, IonQ's stock is pricey right now. Its shares have a forward price-to-sales ratio of 217. After share price gains of more than 250% over the past 12 months, IonQ's stock is trading at a premium. Meanwhile, its revenue is still modest, and losses are significant.
Sure, third-quarter revenue more than doubled, and the company exceeded its revenue guidance up to $12 million for the quarter, delivering $12.4 million instead. But that figure pales in comparison to IonQ's net loss of $52.5 million.
While IonQ is making progress with increasing its sales and expanding partnerships, there's still a lot of uncertainty in quantum computing, and the company's losses are significant. Given that we're still at the beginning of this nascent market, any investment in a quantum computing pure play is risky.
Instead, investors may want to look at other tech companies, like Alphabet, that are makingsignificant gains in quantum computingbut also have greater financial stability.

US5949181045,MSFT,"The Smartest Semiconductor Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a4d796c0-cadf-395f-b971-c295c0512836/the-smartest-semiconductor.html,07:10AM,Finviz.com,"Making smart investments often requires you to not follow the crowd. In the semiconductor industry, you can't follow the crowd any less than buyingIntel(NASDAQ: INTC)stock. While Intel is struggling right now, the company's manufacturing investments still hold a lot of potential and could be the key to the company's turnaround.
Another neglected semiconductor stock isQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), which trades at an uninspiring valuation. While Qualcomm's core smartphone chip business is mature, the company has plenty of long-term growth opportunities in other areas.
If you've got $1,000 to invest, want exposure to semiconductor stocks, and are willing to take some risk, Intel and Qualcomm should be on your radar.
Intel is going through one of thebiggest crises in its decades-long history. The company's expensive bet on becoming a semiconductor foundry has been slow to show progress, market share losses in PC and server CPUs are putting pressure on the financials, and a complete failure to become a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is a particularly embarrassing black eye. There are some bright spots, notably the company's second-generation graphics cards, but overall, the picture certainly looks rough.
Former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who crafted Intel's current strategy, was pushed out in December. The company now lacks a permanent CEO, and its strategy is up in the air. The stock was understandably hammered following abrupt layoffs and a dividend suspension in August, and the rout continued amid the leadership shuffle. Shares of Intel are down more than 55% from their 52-week high, and they trade for below book value.
The silver lining is that Intel is the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer. The company's vast manufacturing assets, based in the U.S. and Europe, are valuable beyond their carrying value on the balance sheet. Intel is almost certainly too important to fail, although spinning off the manufacturing business or other maneuvers are a possibility.
While Intel's predicament looks dire, the company's upcoming Intel 18A manufacturing process could be an inflection point. Intel 18A is expected to bring Intel back on par withTSMCin terms of manufacturing technology, and the company is banking on the process to give its upcoming Panther Lake PC CPUs and Clearwater Forest server CPUs a distinct edge.MicrosoftandAmazonare both signed up to use Intel 18A for various home-grown chips, and if the process meets expectations, more customers could follow suit.
I won't sugarcoat it: Intel stock is risky, and you're going to need an iron stomach to hold the stock through the attempted turnaround. But with Intel valued at less than $100 billion, down about two-thirds from its decade high, the upside for investors could be enormous if the company can get back on its feet.
Qualcomm makes the majority of its revenue from smartphone chips. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company generated $6.1 billion in revenue from smartphones out of $10.2 billion total. Most of the rest came from Internet of Things, automotive, and technology licensing.
While the smartphone market is mature and may not be a major source of growth for Qualcomm, the company is branching out into other areas that hold some long-term promise. One of those areas is the PC market. Qualcomm launched its first PC CPUs last year, which are based on theArmarchitecture just like its smartphone chips, and it worked with Microsoft to make sure Windows and most Windows software worked well on laptops powered by the new chips.
While Qualcomm's PC chips are powerful and efficient, progress has been slow. The company expects to generate $4 billion inannual revenuefrom PC chips by 2029, a small fraction of what market leader Intel generates each year. One thing holding back Qualcomm is compatibility issues. While many applications work fine, some PC games and other applications suffer from serious issues, which may be driving away customers. However, these problems should eventually be solved, and there's no reason why Qualcomm can't turn its PC chip business into a sizable source of revenue in the long run.
Server CPUs are another area where Qualcomm could build another multibillion-dollar business from nothing. The company has already tried and failed once with Arm-powered server CPUs, but it looks likely that it will try again. Arm in the data center is becoming more common as tech giants design their own in-house server chips, meaning that the software ecosystem should be more accommodating to Qualcomm as it reenters the server CPU market.
Qualcomm stock isn't overly expensive, trading for around 15 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings. Growing earnings is going to depend on Qualcomm's success outside of the smartphone market, so multiple failures could keep the stock price in check. However, if the company finds success with PCs, servers, or both over the next five years, Qualcomm stock could be a market-beating winner.

US5949181045,MSFT,Prediction: This Stock Will be the Biggest Winner of the U.S.' New $500 Billion AI Project.,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f2f46e71-62ed-36d5-ac0e-dcdccb3a4eea/prediction%3A-this-stock-will.html,04:07AM,Finviz.com,"Artificial intelligence (AI) companies saw revenue soar last year as data centers built out infrastructure and customers launched AI projects -- and as a result, investors piled into shares of players involved in this high-growth technology. These stocks even drove index gains last year, with AI chip designerNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)scoring the best performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and AI software companyPalantir Technologiesposting the greatest gain in the S&P 500.
Following such momentum, many investors wondered if AI players had seen their best days in 2024 and if growth might stagnate in the new year. After all, revenue and stock prices rarely advance nonstop without marking a pause at some point. But right now may not be the time for any kind of slowdown.
Newly inaugurated President Donald Trump along with AI leadersOracle, OpenAI, andSoftBankthis week announced a $500 billion AI project to assure U.S. leadership in the technology. And my prediction is one stock in particular will be the biggest winner of this massive investment. Let's find out more.
So, first, let's dive into the Stargate Project. Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank, immediately investing $100 billion, will create a new company called Stargate to build out AI infrastructure in the U.S. The total investment may reach as much as $500 billion within a period of four years.
Trump called Stargate the ""largest AI infrastructure project in history,"" and OpenAI said in a statement that the project ""will secure American leadership in AI."" OpenAI also listedArm,Microsoft, Nvidia, and Oracle as the project's main technology partners.
The announcement didn't offer details about how much of the investment would go to particular companies for their products and services -- but I predict the biggest winner of this deal will be Nvidia.
To understand why, it's important to take a look at the AI chip giant's path so far. Nvidia has built a dominant position in the world ofgraphics processing units(GPUs), or the chips that power crucial AI tasks like thetraining and inferencingof large language models. The company offers the world's most powerful GPUs, and customers aiming to lead in AI generally want the best for their projects -- so turn to Nvidia for GPUs.
This is confirmed by what Nvidia chief Jensen Huang has called the ""insane"" demand for the company's latest AI architecture and chip, Blackwell. Demand has surpassed supply as the company launches this new platform, and the world's biggest tech companies -- from Microsoft to Oracle -- are customers.
It's clear that this buildout, requiring data centers and accelerated computing systems, needs GPUs and related products. And the intention to make the U.S. a worldwide leader implies the need for the best possible materials. Enter Nvidia's GPUs.
""As part of Stargate, Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system,"" OpenAI said in the announcement.
Considering that a single Blackwell GPU costs between $30,000 to $40,000, and Nvidia customers generally purchase systems incorporating many GPUs, this new infrastructure buildout represents a considerable opportunity for Nvidia. (For example, Nvidia customers may opt for the GB200 NVL72, which connects 72 Blackwell GPUs and several central processing units or the main processors that power standard computers.) All of this means Stargate could quickly add up to an enormous revenue stream for Nvidia.
So, what does this mean for you as an investor? Right now, Nvidia stock trades for 49x forward earnings estimates, and this may seem expensive. But this valuation actually is reasonable considering the tech giant's earnings track record -- double- and triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters along with gross margin topping 70% -- and long-term prospects.
Today's $200 billion AI market is expected to soar beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade, setting the stage for more growth ahead for Nvidia. And on top of that, my prediction is Nvidia, thanks to the quality of its GPUs, will benefit more than any other company from the Stargate Project.
So, this AI star's enormous gains may be far from over, and that makes it a solid buy for investors right now.
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:
TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
Consider whenNvidiamade this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation,you’d have $902,242!*

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Microsoft (MSFT) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-among-stocks-chatgpt-083842394.html,03:38AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list of15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.
2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth—something that had not happened in nearly three decades.

The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.
In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.
While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration’s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers’ costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.
A growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.
While most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.
Whether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.
We prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.
For perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Overall, MSFTranks 2ndon our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Stargate is currently backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft,a key backer of OpenAI, was listed as atechnology partner in the new joint venture. On Tuesday, Microsoftannounced that its partnership with OpenAI has evolvedso that Microsoft is no longer the sole cloud provider for OpenAI.
While some investors may be concerned the change in the agreement may be bad news for Microsoft, WestEnd Capital Management senior equity analyst Ali Mogharabi tellsMarket Dominationco-hostsJulie HymanandJosh Liptonthat the Stargate announcement is ""more of a win"" for Microsoft in the long run.
The exclusivity change ""lessens [Microsoft's] dependency on the OpenAI [large language models] LLMs ... which basically means that they can provide a variety of options for their enterprise clients that are on Azure,"" Mogharabi explains.
""That's the way we should think about Microsoft when it comes to AI: how well Azure and the Azure revenues are actually benefiting from all of that,"" he says. ""Overall, I think in the long run, we'll see that that was pretty much a net positive for Microsoft.""
Ahead of Microsoft's earnings report next Wednesday, Mogharabi says he's looking for more color about how the company is monetizing AI in its apps and AI agent initiatives.
He explains, ""While the AI initiatives have actually resulted in continuing cloud revenue growth, we'd like to see more clarity on the app monetization side ... [such as] the usage and frequency of those AI features that they've added.""

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI news you should definitely take a look at.
President Trump announced a major investment initiative to advance artificial intelligence in the U.S., involving a joint venture called Stargate with OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and the UAE’s MGX. Initially committing $100 billion, with potential growth of up to $500 billion over four years. The venture will focus on building large data centers, starting in Texas, and creating over 100,000 American jobs. The announcement was made at the White House, with SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Larry Ellison in attendance.
The launch of the AI initiative has sparked a public dispute among major tech leaders. Elon Musk criticized OpenAI’s partnership with the project, questioned the financial backing of companies like SoftBank, and claimed they lack the necessary funds. Sam Altman of OpenAI quickly refuted Musk’s claim in a post on X.

Additionally, CNBC reported that President Trump announced plans to fast-track the construction of power plants for artificial intelligence by using an emergency declaration. The plants would be exempt from climate targets and could use any fuel, including coal for backup power. The aim is to quickly meet the increasing energy demands of AI data centers, as power consumption is expected to rise significantly. While tech companies have focused on renewable energy, natural gas is expected to play a crucial role due to its reliability and faster deployment. Trump emphasized that the plants would connect directly to data centers, bypassing the traditional power grid.

Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, finviz.com, and YCharts. *Not publicly traded. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio. EPS = earnings per share. Data to Jan. 23, 2025.
OpenAI's press release included the key companies involved in Stargate and how responsibilities will be divided:
Initial equity funders: SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX, which is a technology investment firm based in the United Arab Emirates.
Lead partners: SoftBank and OpenAI, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. SoftBank's Son will be the chairman.
Key initial technology partners: Oracle, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft.
Oracle is an enterprise software provider, best known for its database software, and provides cloud computing services. The company has made many acquisitions since its founding in 1977. Its largest one to date is Cerner, which it bought in a $28.3 billion deal that closed in June 2022. Cerner is a leading provider of electronic health record systems.
SoftBank, based in Japan, is an investment holding company that invests in companies around the world. It primarily focuses on tech companies. Notably, it owns a majority stake in chip designer Arm Holdings. In September 2024, SoftBank spun off a portion of its Arm stake via an initial public offering (IPO). This was after Nvidia's deal to acquire Arm from SoftBank fell through due to regulatory issues.
OpenAI is best known as the creator of ChatGPT, the chatbot that wowed the tech world following its release in late 2022. The chatbot is powered by generative AI, a relatively new tech that greatly expands the use cases for AI. ChatGPT's release has led to a stampede among companies and other entities to acquire generative AI capabilities. OpenAI also has other products. Microsoft is a big investor in OpenAI.
Nvidia is the leading provider of chips and related technology -- hardware and software -- to enable advanced AI capabilities. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for processing AI workloads in data centers, which includes training AI models and running AI applications. They're also used outside the data center in ""AI edge applications,"" including within vehicles that are under development for self-driving capabilities and inside robots from drones to humanoids under development.
Microsoft is a software giant best known for its Windows operating system to run personal computers. Its cloud computing service, Azure, is a major part of its current business. In 2019, Microsoft invested its first $1 billion in OpenAI and as of late last year, its total funding commitment was $13 billion. Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's tech in its products.
Arm is the world's largest designer of architectures for central processing unit (CPU) chips. It licenses its intellectual property (IP) to other semiconductor companies and manufacturers of consumer and industrial electronic products. So, it generates licensing revenue and royalties on products sold that use its IP. Its chips have long been ubiquitous in smartphones and other small electronic gadgets, but its growth is largely coming from its newer AI data center market.
I think Nvidia stock is the best stock of this group, though it probably has a somewhat higher risk level than at least Microsoft and Oracle. As the table shows, Nvidia has the highest projected earnings growth rate over the next five years. And its stock valuation of 34.4 times forward projected earnings is reasonable for a company that Wall Street estimates will increase earnings at an average annual pace of 35% over the next five years.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $381,744!*
Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $42,357!*
Netflix:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004,you’d have $531,127!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

US5949181045,MSFT,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Ethical Company to Invest in According to Reddit?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-best-ethical-210707104.html,04:07PM,Finviz.com,"We recently compiled a list of the10 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best ethical companies to invest in according to Reddit.
In an era where corporate responsibility and sustainability are increasingly important, the concept of ethical companies has gained significant traction. Ethical companies are businesses that prioritize social, environmental, and governance (ESG) factors alongside financial performance. These companies aim to minimize their negative impact on the environment, promote social justice, and ensure good governance practices. They strive to reduce their carbon footprint, manage waste effectively, and promote sustainable practices. They also prioritize fair labor practices, support community development, and respect human rights. Ethical companies maintain high standards of transparency, accountability, and integrity in their operations and decision-making processes. Additionally, they engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community, to ensure that their actions are aligned with broader societal values.
People invest in ethical companies for several compelling reasons. One of the primary motivations is risk mitigation. Ethical companies are less likely to face scandals or negative publicity, which can erode investor confidence and stock value. They are also better positioned to comply with existing and future regulations, reducing the risk of fines and legal issues. This can provide a more stable and predictable investment environment. Another reason is the potential for long-term value. Ethical companies often have more sustainable business models, which can lead to long-term growth and stability. They are frequently at the forefront of innovation, developing new products and services that meet the evolving needs of a conscious consumer base.
Investors are also drawn to ethical companies because of their alignment with their personal values. Many investors are driven by a desire to make a positive impact on society. By investing in ethical companies, they can support businesses that share their values and contribute to social and environmental causes they care about. This alignment can provide a sense of satisfaction and purpose beyond financial returns.

According to a report by Grand View Research, the global ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing market size was estimated at $25.10 trillion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.8% from 2024 to 2030. This significant growth is driven by a confluence of factors, including heightened public awareness of environmental and social issues, improved transparency in corporate ESG practices, and the increasing availability of ESG data and analytics.
Over the past decade, climate change protests, natural disasters, and social justice movements have brought environmental and social issues to the forefront of public consciousness. These events have underscored the urgent need for sustainable practices, leading to a paradigm shift in how investors approach their investment decisions. Today, investors are more conscious of the impact their investments have on the world and are increasingly seeking options that align with their personal values and contribute positively to environmental sustainability and social equity.
The availability of information about companies’ ESG practices has also improved significantly. Investors now have access to detailed reports, ratings, and analyses that provide insights into a company’s environmental impact, social initiatives, and governance practices. This transparency enables investors to make more informed decisions and choose investments that align with their values.
Ethical companies are poised for substantial growth, driven by increasing public awareness, improved transparency, and regulatory support.

Shares of Lumen were elevated by the recent announcement of President Trump's Project Stargate.
President Trump, alongside key leaders from around Silicon Valley, announced from the White House this week that AI infrastructure was getting a major influx of cash. Dubbed Project Stargate, the initiative will involve $500 billion in private investment -- much of which will be provided bySoftBank-- focused on building out Americanartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure.
Lumen's technology helps facilitate rapid communication in AI data centers. Having inked key deals withMetaandMicrosoftthis year, the latter of which may be one of the first to see Project Stargate dollars given its privileged relationship with OpenAI, the company is in a position to benefit.
Beyond this, a general sense of optimism permeates the AI sector this week after President Trump rolled back Biden-era regulations.
Despite the wave of enthusiasm, Lumen's future remains unclear. The company has repeatedly missed earnings targets all while failing to consistently turn a profit or grow revenues. In fact, the company's top line has shrunk from $21.5 billion in 2019 to $14.6 billion last year. I would avoid Lumen for now.

In an interview at CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box,’ Alexandr Wang, founder, and CEO of Scale AI, shared his insights on the ongoing AI competition between the U.S. and China, and emphasized its critical importance. Wang noted that while the U.S. has been ahead in AI for the past decade, Chinese labs, especially DeepSeek, are narrowing the gap. He said:
“It has been true for a long time that the United States has been ahead. And that's been true for, you know, maybe the past decade. That being said, you know, the very recent event, on Christmas Day, you know, about a month ago, DeepSeek released a model, which by the way, I think is symbolic that the Chinese lab releases, you know, an earth-shattering model on Christmas Day when, you know, the rest of us are sort of celebrating the holiday. And they released it to much fanfare, and then they followed up with their Reasing Model, DeepSeek R1, which is the one that we evaluated as top of the leaderboard. You know, the reality is, yes and no. So, you know, the Chinese labs, they have more H100s than people think, you know.”

He revealed that DeepSeek has access to around 50,000 H100 chips, despite U.S. export controls, and suggested that Chinese AI development may be more advanced than many expect. Wang also discussed the quick pace of AI model development and mentioned that different models excel in different areas. For example, OpenAI’s models are strong in reasoning, while Anthropic’s models are good at coding.
Regarding the new $500 billion Stargate project, Wang stressed that the U.S. needs significant infrastructure and computational power to maintain its AI leadership. He expressed concern that the growing competition will require the U.S. to rapidly build more data centers and invest in energy to fuel AI progress. While there are discussions around the future of AI models and whether fewer, larger companies will dominate, Wang believes the market is set for exponential growth, and could potentially become a trillion-dollar scale as AI advances toward superintelligence or artificial general intelligence in the next few years.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides a variety of AI-driven solutions, including cloud services, productivity tools, and business applications, to improve business operations and security. The company has also made huge investments in AI development.
According to a January 23 report by The Guardian, leaked documents reveal that Microsoft deepened its relationship with Israel's military during the Gaza war, providing significant support with cloud technology and AI systems.
As demand for storage and computing surged during the conflict, Microsoft played a key role, supplying the IDF with Azure services and technical support, generating about $10 million in fees. Microsoft worked on sensitive projects, including supporting elite intelligence units like Unit 8200 and handling data for military operations.

Ina splashy announcementon his second day in office, President Trump told Americans that a new $500 billion project — backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI — would generate “ over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.”
The projectcreated a company called Stargate, which said in Tuesday's announcement it would “begin deploying $100 billion immediately"" starting with data centers in Texas and spend an additional $400 billion over the next four years.
Trump called the project, ""a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential under a new president.""
Microsoft (MSFT), AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and British chip designer Arm (ARM) were named as “key initial technology partners” by Stargate. The stocks of all companies involved soared, withOracle and Nvidia rising 7% and 4%,respectively, the day after the announcement.
But these early announcements have been followed by social media feuds featuring Elon Musk, questions about funding, and rival announcements about AI investments slated for this year.
Trump's close ally, Elon Musk,took aim at Stargate’s backerson his social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Responding to a post from OpenAI about the project, he wrote, ""They don’t actually have the money,"" adding, ""SoftBank has well under $10B secured.""
Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wrote back, “Wrong, as you surely know.” OpenAI hasraised nearly $17 billionin the past two years and opened up a $4 billion credit line with various banks, though the company saidit expected to lose $5 billionin 2024 while generating only $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAIwould need to raise an additional $19 billion to fund Stargate, according to The Information.
A person familiar with Stargate refuted Musk's claims, telling Yahoo Finance that the project is indeed prepared to immediately deploy the initial $100 billion investment, noting that SoftBank had $24 billion in cash as of its most recent quarterly earnings.
The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that Stargate has not yet secured its required funding, will receive no government financing, andwill only serve OpenAIonce completed.
So far, only about4% of Americans report using AI daily in their workplaces, thoughalmost all Americans use AI-enabled products in their daily lives, often without realizing it.
Then there’s the question of whether the project will hold true to Trump’s jobs promise, as data centers typically employ fewer than 100 people.
Apple’s (AAPL) $1.3 billion data center project in Iowa, for example,committed to employing just 50 peoplein permanent positions, according to a Forbes investigation. All the while, critics say nondisclosure agreements between data centers and local officials meanresidents are often left in the dark about the colossal buildings in their backyardsdriving up their utility bills. And some lawmakersargue that tax breaks for data centers aren’t worth the cost.
Bloomberg reported this week that the first data center associated with Stargate in Abilene, Texas,will employ just 57 peopleat an average wage of $57,600 per year.
On the heels of the Stargate announcement, Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Friday thatMeta(META)will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025, far higher than the estimated spending of $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024 it disclosed to investors back in October. Wall Street analysts had expected Meta's capital expenditures to tally closer to $51 billion this year, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
Much of Meta's spending would go into building a 2-gigawatt data center “that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” Zuckerberg said. Two gigawatts isenough energy to power 700 electric vehiclesfor a full year.
To be sure, proponents argue that the data centers have ripple effects on local economies. “Each direct job in the U.S. data center industry helps to create 7.4 ancillary jobs on average throughout the U.S. economy,”commercial real estate firm CBRE wrotein a report last year.
As OpenAI's Altmanwroteon X: ""This is great for the country.""

US5949181045,MSFT,Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-prices-look-expensive-and-inflated-billionaire-investor-ray-dalio-160240482.html,11:02AM,Finviz.com,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTubeor wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
A warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.
""I think it depends on what stocks — yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,"" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (video above; listen in below).
Dalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become ""so expensive.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
If the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.
""If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,"" Dalio said, adding, ""Rotation is the important consideration.""
Dalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over thecompany's investment strategies.
The investment veteran, with anestimated net worthof $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet — if at all.
In an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation —or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimpingconsumer purchasing power.
More recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called ""How Countries Go Broke.""
Worst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.

Investors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration,policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in topMag Sevennames like Nvidia.

Stocks are ""priced for perfection,"" warned Goldman Sachs strategistPeter Oppenheimer this month.
Dalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.
""I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,"" said Dalio.

US5949181045,MSFT,Meta to spend as much as $65 billion on AI in 2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-to-spend-as-much-as-65-billion-on-ai-in-2025-155259000.html,10:52AM,Finviz.com,"Meta (META) is turning up the heat on the AI competition. On Friday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to pour billions more into its artificial intelligence development efforts, construct a massive new data center, and launch its Llama 4 foundation model in the coming months.
Meta stock was up less than 1% following the news.
In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said the company will significantly ramp up its capital expenditures, saying Meta will pour $60 billion to $65 billion into its expansion plans. That's an enormous increase from the $38 billion to $40 billion the company said it planned to spend during its 2024 fiscal year.
Meta reports its earnings results on Jan. 29.
In his post, Zuckerberg laid out his expectations for 2025, saying that Meta AI, the company's AI assistant, will serve more than 1 billion people and that Llama 4 will become the leading, state-of-the-art model. The CEO also said Meta will build an AI engineer that will begin contributing code to the company's research and development efforts.
A large chunk of Meta's expansion plan includes building a more than 2-gigawatt data center in Louisiana that Zuckerberg said will be so large it would cover a huge portion of Manhattan. The company plans to have 1 gigawatt worth of construction completed in 2025 and to end the year with a whopping 1.3 million GPUs powering AI development. The company didn't say where it plans to build the center, however.
Meta is in an AI arms race with its Silicon Valley rivals, as tech companies work to outpace each other in creating ever more powerful AI models. Unlike other companies, Meta's Llama models are open source, meaning developers can access and adjust the software as they see fit.
Meta's rivals aren't sitting still, though. Microsoft (MSFT) and its partner OpenAI continue to push out new AI updates includingOpenAI's new Operator AI agentthat can perform tasks via its own browser for you.
And on Tuesday, Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI, and SoftBankannounced their Stargate Project, a $500 billion effort to build AI data centers across the US.
Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, are building out their respective AI platforms while investing billions in OpenAI rival Anthropic. Earlier this week, Google agreed to investanother $1 billion in the company. That builds on the prior $2 billion Google already invested in the firm.

US5949181045,MSFT,Insights Into Microsoft (MSFT) Q2: Wall Street Projections for Key Metrics,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insights-microsoft-msft-q2-wall-141503364.html,09:15AM,Finviz.com,"Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft (MSFT) to post quarterly earnings of $3.13 per share in its upcoming report, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.8%. Revenues are expected to be $68.7 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.
Over the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.5% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.
Before a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.
While it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.
Given this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Microsoft metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.
Analysts forecast 'Revenue- Intelligent Cloud' to reach $25.75 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.5%.
Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- More Personal Computing' should arrive at $14.13 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -16.4% year over year.
The consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Productivity and Business Processes' will reach $28.85 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +49.9% from the prior-year quarter.
The average prediction of analysts places 'More Personal Computing- Search and news advertising' at $3.46 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +7.6% year over year.
According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'More Personal Computing- Revenue from Gaming' should come in at $6.47 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -9% year over year.
Analysts predict that the 'Intelligent Cloud- Enterprise Services and partner service' will reach $1.97 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +2.8% year over year.
The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Percentage Change in Revenue Y/Y' of 10.9%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 18%.
The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Intelligent Cloud - Percentage Change in Revenue Y/Y' will likely reach 19.6%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 20%.
Analysts' assessment points toward 'Productivity and Business Processes - Percentage Change in Revenue Y/Y' reaching 11.6%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 13%.
The consensus estimate for 'More Personal Computing - Percentage Change in Revenue Y/Y' stands at -3.4%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 19% in the same quarter last year.
Analysts expect 'Long-term unearned revenue' to come in at $3.72 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $2.97 billion in the same quarter last year.
It is projected by analysts that the 'Short-term unearned revenue' will reach $47.72 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $43.07 billion.View all Key Company Metrics for Microsoft here>>>Shares of Microsoft have demonstrated returns of +2% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change.

We recently published a list of12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.
Historically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market’s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow’s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.

Since the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.
Trump’s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.
The U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.
Investing in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.
We shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational tech giant. The company has unmatched achievements within the enterprise ecosystem, driven by integrated solutions designed specifically for business needs. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, Azure, has become the company’s leading growth driver.
In FY2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated $211 billion in revenue, mainly driven by Azure as it accounted for 43% of the total sales. At 22%, Azure holds the second-largest share of the global cloud market after AWS. Azure’s hybrid cloud features effectively merge on-premises and cloud-based systems, making it highly efficient for enterprise customers. The segment’s 67% gross margin in 2024 reflects its scalability and profitability across the company’s cloud services, playing a vital role in MSFT’s overall business growth.
In Q1 FY2025, Microsoft Corporation’s revenue was reported at $65.6 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Operating income was recorded at around $30.6 billion, up by 14% year-over-year. The company’s cloud segment experienced a 33% increase in Azure and other cloud services. The company ended Q1 with more than $20.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The growing AI infrastructure in the U.S. will allow Microsoft to expand its cloud operations and integrate with new clients.
Overall, MSFTranks 2ndon our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

US5949181045,MSFT,Should You Start the New Year With the Vanguard Growth ETF or the Vanguard Value ETF?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/df189aaf-458f-327a-8e03-822b35443a7c/should-you-start-the-new-year.html,06:35AM,Finviz.com,"Investment management firm Vanguard offers a variety ofexchange-traded funds (ETFs)that allow investors to target a specific theme or sector at a low cost.
With just 0.04% expense ratios, meaning $0.40 for every $1,000 invested, theVanguard Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: VUG)and theVanguard Value ETF(NYSEMKT: VTV)are two massive, ultra-low-cost funds that target large-cap stocks offered on U.S. exchanges.
Here are some key insights into each fund to help you decide which is the best choice for you in 2025.
The simplest way to understand the differences between the Vanguard Growth ETF and the Vanguard Value ETF is to know what each fund comprises and how that composition stacks up against theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO), which mirrors the performance of theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).

Data source: Vanguard.
As you can see in the table, the Vanguard Growth ETF is heavily concentrated in technology, communications, and consumer discretionary. In fact, 60% of the fund is inApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms,Tesla,Broadcom, andNetflix. Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom are in the tech sector; Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Netflix are in communications; and Amazon and Tesla are in consumer discretionary.
The Vanguard Growth ETF holds top payment processorsVisaandMastercard, as well asS&P GlobalandMoody's, but it doesn't include the big banks likeJPMorgan Chase, the investment banksGoldman SachsandMorgan Stanley, orBerkshire Hathaway. These companies are core components of thefinancial sector, which is the sector with the highest weight in the Vanguard Value ETF.
The Value ETF is significantly more balanced than the Growth ETF or even the S&P 500. The largest holding, Berkshire Hathaway, makes up just 3.9% of the fund, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 3.1%, Broadcom at 2.5%,ExxonMobilat 2.2%, andUnitedHealth Groupat 2.2%. So, it is not nearly as concentrated as the S&P 500 or the Growth ETF.
By excluding the big tech-focused companies, the Value ETF has a lower valuation and a higher yield than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. It has also underperformed the S&P 500 and the Growth ETF in recent years (even when factoring in dividends), given the outsize gains of stocks like Nvidia, Broadcom, Meta, and others.
However, the fund has still produced solid gains, largely thanks to its concentration in financials. Financials were the second-best-performing sector in 2024 -- behind only communications.
The Vanguard Growth ETF and Vanguard Value ETF are two simple yet effective ways to invest in small pieces of hundreds of large-cap stocks. But the Vanguard Growth ETF has become less diversified in recent years, whereas the Vanguard Value ETF is still very diversified, even with its focus on financials, industrials, and healthcare.
One thing to be careful about when approaching either ETF -- or any ETF, for that matter -- is accidentally increasing your exposure to companies you already own and don't necessarily want to buy more of.
For example, if one-fifth of your portfolio is already in big banks and Berkshire Hathaway, the Vanguard Value ETF isn't going to provide the diversification you may be looking for. Similarly, if you already own a lot of big tech stocks and are comfortable with your positions, you probably don't want to go with the Vanguard Growth ETF.
I think the best reason to buy either fund is as an alternative to an S&P 500 index fund. Put another way, you want to deploy money into the market through a passive investment vehicle but in a way that better suits your investment objectivesand risk tolerance and complementsyour current holdings.
If you've ridden the growth stock rally to new heights but are still putting new savings to work in the market, you may be tempted to sell out of winning growth stocks. But a better approach is to only sell a stock for a specific reason, such as the investment thesis changing or the risk and potential reward no longer being worth a premium valuation -- not just because a stock has gone up. By putting new money into an ETF that holds companies you mostly don't own, you diversify your portfolio without needing to trade in and out of positions.
By the same token, investors who own mostly value and dividend stocks and want more exposure to growth stocks may want to take a closer look at the Vanguard Growth ETF. Buying stocks at all-time highs is never easy. After all, no one wants to buy a stock after a major run-up just to watch it fall back down. The Vanguard Growth ETF is heavily concentrated, but it can still help smooth out the risks of one stock nosediving.
Perhaps most importantly, holding an ETF through periods of volatility can be less stressful than an individual stock. We're all human, so it's easy to second-guess an investment thesis when a stock goes down, especially relative to its peer group. So, if there's a general sell-off in big tech and you own, let's say, Microsoft and Broadcom, you may overly worry about why those companies are going down. But if you own the Vanguard Growth ETF, you may find it easier to keep calm and let the cycle play out.
In sum, investing in the Vanguard Growth ETF or the Vanguard Value ETF are great choices to kick off the new year. Just make sure to review the holdings list of both ETFs so you're informed before diving in headfirst.

US5949181045,MSFT,Should You Buy Bloom Energy Stock While It's Around $28?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d0b1eaf9-fad2-3334-8cd4-1bccf631f2e9/should-you-buy-bloom-energy.html,04:05AM,Finviz.com,"As artificial intelligence (AI) advances and its applications expand across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and manufacturing, the need for reliable energy solutions to power data centers is becoming increasingly urgent. Many companies are actively seeking scalablerenewable energy sourcesto address this challenge and support their growing requirements.
This is whereBloom Energy(NYSE: BE)has an opportunity. With its innovative fuel cell technology, it is capable of meeting technology companies' energy needs today -- not five or 10 years down the road.
The company recently secured a massive agreement that could foreshadow more significant deals, and the stock has surged by an impressive 149% since November. Recently, though, the stock has fallen by 17% from its 52-week high, and trades below $28 per share as I write this. Is it a buy today?
The quick uptake in the use of AI technology has led to a significant increase in the demand for energy from the data centers that support this software.Goldman Sachsforecasts that data center power demand will increase at an annualized rate of 15% through 2030. That would leave data centers responsible for roughly 8% of the total power consumption in the United States.
Technology companies are actively seeking solutions to accommodate their data centers' increasing energy consumption. In September,Microsoftentered into a 20-year power purchase agreementwithConstellation Energythat will bring Three Mile Island's Unit 1 nuclear reactor back online.
Fuel cells could also help meet this growing need. For instance, Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell technology efficiently converts renewable fuel sources like biogas and hydrogen without combustion. It provides dependable, low-carbon energy, and microgrid solutions for clients that need resilient power.
A significant advantage that Bloom has over some other emerging energy companies is that its technology is ready to deploy today. It can be implemented for clients in just 50 days, and used to complement the energy supplied by the power grid. Furthermore, this technology allows data centers to function independently as ""islands,"" eliminating their dependence on the electric grid -- making it an especially attractive option for energy-intensive AI businesses.
Since the company went public in 2018, it has struggled financially. In the last year, Bloom Energy incurred losses of nearly $130 million against total revenues of $1.25 billion. Although it has improved its margins, securing additional large clients will be essential to further validate its offerings and move the company toward positive cash flow. Over the past year, it has done just that.
In May, the company announced a power purchase agreement withIntelto install additional megawatts of its fuel cell-based Energy Server at Intel's high-performance computing data center in Santa Clara, California. In July, it partnered with theNvidia-backed AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to generate on-site power for its high-performance data center in Illinois.
In November,American Electric Powersigned an agreement to purchase up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of solid-state fuel cells from Bloom Energy for data centers and other large commercial and industrial applications.Evercore, an investment bank, described this development as a ""big win"" for the company, while Morningstar called it ""a potential game changer for Bloom.""
Following the deal, analysts atMorgan Stanleyraised their EBITDA estimates for Bloom by 35% for 2025 and 62% for 2026, anticipating that the order will be filled over the next four years.
As energy demand grows, Bloom Energy looks particularly appealing because its products are ready to deploy today. Contrast this with traditional nuclear power plants, which take years to construct and bring online, and small modular nuclear reactors, which may not be ready for commercial deployment until the 2030s.
Bloom Energy is making solid progress, and its partnership with American Electric will help it showcase its ability to provide quick, scalable energy solutions. It also puts Bloom in a prime position with a utility client that has forecast a 20% annual growth in its commercial load over the next three years.
Analysts covering the stock expect that Bloom could report earnings of $0.06 per share in 2024, and project that could grow to $0.43 per share in 2025.
There are risks here for investors if new deals fail to materialize or if the deal with American Electric Power -- which isn't a firm order -- fails to meet expectations. For that reason, this up-and-coming energy stock isn't suitable for conservative investors. That said, Bloom has made solid progress and will look to build on its momentum in 2025, making it a good growth stock pick for long-term investors willing to tolerate some risk.

US5949181045,MSFT,Billionaire Bill Gates Has 51% of His Trust Invested in 2 Megacap Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/97e6e52f-40fe-3942-9b4c-b07a1d8ccaa9/billionaire-bill-gates-has.html,04:04AM,Finviz.com,"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) engages in various philanthropic activities around the world. The grant payments made by the organization come from the BMGF Trust, which holds and invests the endowment.
The BMGF Trust has outperformed theS&P 500by 13 percentage points in the last three years, due in part to concentrated positions in two megacap stocks. As of September, 28% of the portfolio was invested inMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)and 23% was invested inBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).
These companies operate in very different parts of the economy, but both have been brilliant investments. During the three-year period that ended in September 2024, Microsoft returned 52% and Berkshire returned 68%, while the S&P 500 advanced 33%. Here's what investors should know about these megacap stocks.
Microsoft has two important growth engines inenterprise softwareand cloud services and already has a strong position in both markets. It's the largest software company and second-largest public cloud, as measured by sales. But Microsoft is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) in both areas to create new revenue streams.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is a generative AI assistant that automates tasks across its office productivity software. That includes revising text in Word, creating slides in PowerPoint, and organizing data in Excel.
Nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies use the product. Similarly, Copilot Studio lets businesses build custom AI assistants, and its user base doubled sequentially in the last quarter.
In cloud computing, Microsoft Azure lost 3 percentage points of market share in the September quarter, but its partnership with OpenAI is an important advantage. It positions Azure as the sole cloud provider to OpenAI, such that it benefits from ChatGPT usage. Additionally, usage of Azure OpenAI Service, which lets businesses integrate OpenAI models into custom generative AI applications, doubled in the last six months.
CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the recent earnings call, ""Our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone.""Morgan Stanleyanalyst Keith Weiss sees Microsoft as the ""clearest AI winner in software."" He estimates AI revenue will jump 160% to $26 billion by fiscal 2026 (ends in June 2026). That could help Azure regain lost market share.
Wall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to grow at 13% annually through fiscal 2026. That makes the current valuation of 37 times earnings look rather expensive.
I think investors should wait for a better buying opportunity. But among the 59 analysts following Microsoft, the median target is $500 per share. That implies 12% upside from the current share price of $446.
Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company with dozens of subsidiaries that operate across a diverse range of industries, including insurance, freight railroad transportation, manufacturing, retail, and utilities. However the insurance businesses are the most important because they generate ""float,"" which is investable cash in the form of policy premiums that haven't been paid out in claims.
Berkshire is the world leader in insurance float, meaning it has more capital available for investment than other insurance companies. CEO Warren Buffett and his understudies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have invested that money to great effect. Berkshire's book value per share, a good measure of intrinsic value, has increased by 11% annually over the last three years.
Buffett says the company has historically paid ""less than nothing"" for its float. That means its insurance business has been profitable on a cumulative basis, which reflects disciplined underwriting. Indeed, Berkshire achieved a combined ratio of 89% through the first three quarters of 2024, better than the industry average of 98%. Values below 100% indicate profitable underwriting.
Wall Street expects Berkshire's operating earnings to increase by 4% annually through 2025. That consensus makes the current valuation of 24 times operating earnings look expensive. Also, shares currently trade at 1.57 times book value, a small but important premium to the three-year average of 1.46. Finally, Buffett chose not to repurchase stock in the most recent quarter, marking thefirst time he has not bought shares in 25 quarters.
In short, Berkshire is an excellent company, but the stock is relatively expensive today. Even Buffett seems to agree.
I think investors should wait for a better entry point before buying the stock. Among the six analysts following the company, the median target is $531 per share, which implies 15% upside from the current share price of $461.

It’s a big-ticket purchase, so you research online before visiting a store to look at and listen to the models you’ve shortlisted. But your store visit falls short of expectations. A combination of excessive waiting to speak to a store associate and a lack of product information in-store undermines your purchasing motivation, and you go elsewhere.
344
Rank onFortune 500 Europe
Bridging the digital divide between consumers’ expectations and their physical in-store journey has become a key objective for retailers. We’ve talked about omnichannel for years without ever really understanding or defining it; consumer behavior and our fickle nature are changing all that. One business that understands this is Currys, a U.K.-based electrical retailer, ranked 344 on the Fortune 500 Europe.
Back in May 2024, Currys announced that it had selected Accenture and Microsoft to deliver its core cloud technology infrastructure that will enable the retailer to leverage the latest AI technologies to enhance operations, elevate the shopping experience, and improve the colleague experience.
Andy Gamble, Currys Group Chief Information and Transformation Officer said: “We’re already seeing firsthand the incredible power of new technologies such as AI in making Currys easier to shop for our customers. We’re fully embracing these technological advances throughout Currys, ensuring we remain at the forefront of digital transformation”.
""We’re already seeing firsthand the incredible power of new technologies such as AI in making Currys easier to shop for our customers....""
Andy Gamble, Currys Group Chief Information and Transformation Officer
Accenture and Microsoft, together with their joint venture Avanade, will work closely with Currys to modernize, secure, and simplify its technology estate, enabling Currys to accelerate the adoption of Microsoft AI technologies such as Azure OpenAI Service.
Amongst the customer benefits they anticipated from such a move are:
Making it easier to shop:Through personalized relevant product information and suggestions tailored to the consumer’s needs in the moment.
Building customers for life:By providing Currys’ customers with an improved post-sales experience and warranty services.
Enhance the colleague experience: By equipping colleagues with faster and easier access to information such as product availability, delivery costs, and add-on services while also identifying potential cross and upselling opportunities.
Digital transformation at Currys also includes switching from paper product pricing to electronic shelf edge labeling. The retailer plans to roll this out to 100 U.K. and Ireland stores by April 2025. It hopes that with clear labeling and easy-to-scan QR codes for further information, the customer journey will be a lot smoother.
To further improve the in-store experience, Currys is planning to introduce a digital queuing system. This new process will be fronted by dedicated ‘Sales Floor Leaders’ who will be on-hand to give customers a ‘warm welcome’ and be identifiable to customers with ‘Here to Help’ hi-vis.
Bridging the digital divide between consumers’ expectations and their physical in-store journey has become a key objective for retailers.
Integrated into colleagues’ ‘store-mode’ tablets that are used to process customer orders, shoppers can now join a digital line to speak to a tech expert – improving the in-store experience, better managing their wait time expectations, and freeing them up to browse the store until a colleague is ready to serve them.
Gamble continued, “We are also trialing exciting new generative AI opportunities in store, utilizing this to provide our customers and colleagues with tools and data to power the expert advice we're proud to provide, as well as to enhance our aftersales journeys and deliver store efficiencies. We've got an ambitious plan going forward and will continue to innovate and invest in making Currys the best place for us to help everyone to enjoy amazing technology.”
Of course, none of these initiatives themselves provides the silver bullet to transforming Currys’ in-store customer service, and this is one of the challenges facing retailers as they continue to develop and evolve their digital strategies. The ingredients may be known, however, it is how they are mixed that determines the outcome.

US5949181045,MSFT,Tevogen Bio Highlights the Future of AI-Driven Drug Development in Fireside Chat with Microsoft During the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tevogen-bio-highlights-future-ai-005300691.html,07:53PM,Finviz.com,"WARREN, N.J., Jan. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc.(“Company” or “Tevogen Bio”) (Nasdaq:TVGN), a clinical-stage specialty immunotherapy biotech developing off-the-shelf, genetically unmodified T-cell therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancers, today announced key insights from its recent fireside chat during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has been critical for Tevogen Bio, given its core commitment to patient equity. By applying ML through Tevogen.AI, the company has already achieved notable cost and time efficiencies, developments that could translate directly into savings for patients. The discussion featured Dr. David Rhew, Global Chief Medical Officer & VP of Healthcare at Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT), and Mittul Mehta, Chief Information Officer and Head of Tevogen.AI, who shared their vision for how AI is revolutionizing drug development and healthcare delivery.
Accelerating Drug Discovery
In the fireside chat, Dr. Rhew described how AI-driven modeling and simulation are drastically reducing the time required to identify and develop drug candidates. He provided an example where a computational task that previously may have taken “thousands of years” using traditional approaches was completed in a matter of months thanks to AI-powered tools. These breakthroughs, Dr. Rhew noted, illustrate a paradigm shift in what is now possible in the pharmaceutical research and development process.
The Rise of Generative AI and Multimodal Data
Both speakers emphasized that while generative AI has garnered widespread attention, next-generation approaches extend beyond simply creating text or images. According to Dr. Rhew, organizations are increasingly deploying multimodal data AI, which processes data from diverse sources, such as imaging, genomics, and electronic health records, to reveal novel insights. Generative AI then serves as a powerful query engine on top of these “foundation models,” enabling seamless interpretation and conversion of complex data into clinically relevant results and formats.
Ensuring Data Quality, Privacy, and Responsible AI
Speaking to Tevogen Bio’s AI developments, Mittul Mehta, Chief Information Officer and Head of Tevogen.AI, highlighted, “We are creating curated datasets, supported by wet-lab research, to fuel the creation of reliable foundational AI models."" Dr. Rhew echoed the need for “clean” and “annotated” datasets, stating, “AI is like a powerful engine. It can take us anywhere, but it needs clean, curated data as fuel. Crude data won't work; it must be refined and properly annotated to be useful."" Both speakers also stressed the importance of strong data governance and privacy-preserving techniques, such as federated learning and confidential compute, which enable secure collaboration on sensitive datasets without exposing proprietary information or intellectual property. Dr. Rhew underscored that responsible AI requires bias mitigation, transparency, and continuous oversight. Mr. Mehta commended Microsoft’s commitment to these principles, stating that responsible development practices are vital to ensuring equitable and safe adoption of AI technologies in healthcare.
“AI is the next industrial revolution and could be humanity’s greatest leap yet. I commend efforts similar to Stargate for their investment in forward-thinking and transformative technologies,” said Ryan Saadi, MD, MPH, Founder and CEO of Tevogen Bio. “Drug development will undoubtedly improve with the power of AI, but the key is to seamlessly bridge medical science and technology. As a biotech focused on pioneering through AI, we remain committed to advancing affordable medical innovation.”

US5949181045,MSFT,Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-opens-a-divide-between-us-and-eu-over-big-tech-213413056.html,04:34PM,Finviz.com,"President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.
Trump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan and Santander’s Ana Botín.
“They took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn’t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they’re after Facebook for billions and billions,” Trump said about the bloc’s regulators.
“These are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn’t be doing that. And as far as I’m concerned, it’s a form of taxation,” he added.
The EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hitApple’s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.
In March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company’s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.”
Google (GOOG,GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September,forcing the company to pay $2.7 billionfor using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over itsAndroid operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose “illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.”
In November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breachedantitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.
Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven’t escaped the EU’s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company tochange its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued astatement of objections to Microsoftover its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.
The EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.
After winning a landmarkantitrust case against Google’s search businessin August, the Department of Justice in November signaledit wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.
The DOJ has alsofiled an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.
The Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta.In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.
It further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company’s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.
In the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media companyran an illegal “buy-or-bury” schemeto either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.
The FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.
Ahead of the 2024 election,Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate’s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump’s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.
Ahead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post’s editorial board from endorsing Trump’s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.
Google and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
Altman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump’s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump’s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.
With Big Tech working to gain Trump’s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there’s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.

US5949181045,MSFT,HP stockpiling computers ahead of potential Trump tariffs: CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hp-stockpiling-computers-ahead-of-potential-trump-tariffs-ceo-203002131.html,03:30PM,Finviz.com,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND — HP Inc. (HPQ) is joining a list of consumer companies stockpiling products ahead ofpotential tariffsfrom President Trump.
""We did some increases of our own inventory during the last month,"" HP CEOEnrique Lorestold Yahoo Finance at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland. ""It's more final product, not so much components, to mitigate the impact at the beginning.""
Lores's action mirrors that of whiskey giant Suntory, whose CEO Tak Niinamitold Yahoo Finance at WEFhe has stockpiled enough booze in Europe to last a year.
Suffice to say, all eyes are on artificial intelligence PC demand and tariffs for HP in 2025.
HPsells its products in Chinaand relies on the country for key component sourcing. If higher tariffs go into effect, it could raise material costs and force it to raise consumer prices.
Read more:What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?
The Consumer Technology Association recently estimated thatproposed tariffs from the Trump administrationcould increase laptop and tablet prices by as much as 46%. Smartphones could see a 26% price increase. Trump has floated tariffs of 10% to 20% on most imports and 60% tariffs on Chinese imports.
A board member of a large US electronics retailer told Yahoo Finance at WEF that 50% of their time is currently spent studying possible tariff scenarios. A good chunk of what the company sells, such as headphones and speakers, is exposed to China, the source said.
In a hawkish speech at WEF on Thursday, Trump floated 25% tariffs on the European Union. He didn't say whether he would enact more tariffs on China, as he has suggested consistently.
As tariff concerns swirl, HP has reported a few mixed quarters.
Sales of consumer PCs fell 4% in the most recent quarter, while commercial sales improved 5%. Operating margins in the PC division fell sharply year over year.
Similar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.
Consumer PCs are under slight pressure as customers await new AI computer releases and spend more money on experiences.
""The challenging near-term fundamentals for the PC market are already well understood, although HPQ is facing greater headwinds in relation to competitive pricing dynamics in the market as it attempts to pass through pricing to recover higher memory costs,"" JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a client note.

The Guardian reports that the IDF's usage of Azure machine learning technologies surged 64-fold between September 2023 and March 2024. Thanks also to Microsoft's collaboration with OpenAI, the IDF could use GPT-4 for natural language processing. This use happened despite OpenAI's publicly declared restrictions barring military use of its technologies, the paper said.
The investigation by The Guardian also revealed that the IDF depended on services provided by rival internet corporations Google (GOOGL,Financials) and Amazon (AMZN,Financials). The dependence on many technology suppliers follows a trend wherein big technological businesses participate in military activities worldwide, reports The Guardian.

Speaking during the company's ""AI Tour"" in Johannesburg, Barnard underlined the initiative's aim to equip individuals in all spheres, including enterprises, government, and youth, thereby enhancing South Africa's competitiveness in the global digital economy. She withheld financial specifics of the initiative, however.
This statement aligns with Microsoft'sprevious $3 billionvow to grow its cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in India over the next two years. By 2030, the investment will have trained 10 million individuals in disciplines linked to artificial intelligence. Like the South Africa program, the India project stresses fair access to artificial intelligence capabilities and seeks to assist startups and entrepreneurs in generating employment and innovation.

US5949181045,MSFT,"Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-are-coming-and-trump-will-be-top-of-mind-for-investors-154048872.html,10:41AM,Finviz.com,"Big Tech’s earnings season kicks off this week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry’s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well underway and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new artificial intelligence models.
And looming over all of that will be how newly inaugurated President Trump will impact tech’s biggest trend in years. Whether it’s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies’ bottom lines.
Trump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday,announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the US. And on Thursday, Trumpsigned an executive orderaimed at ensuring US dominance in AI.
It’s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.
Investors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don’t end up on the wrong end of Trump’s proposedtariffs on goods from China.
Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG,GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.
There’s also the fate of the CHIPS Act. The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chipmakers, saying it was “so bad” during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election.
Without the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chipmaking facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it’s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.
In addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.
During its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn’t enough to satisfy investors,sending the company’s stock sinking 5%the day after the report.
Meta’s stock suffered a similar setbackfollowing its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 capital expenditures would increase from $37 billion-$40 billion to $38 billion-$40 billion.
Google and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.
Microsoft shares are up around 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC), which has risen 26% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 52% and 35%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 66%.
One of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.
If Trump and TikTok can’t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn but competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.
But with Trump proclaiming that he’d “save” TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.

US5949181045,MSFT,Salesforce's AI Agents Pivot Is Already Showing Results,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforces-ai-agents-pivot-already-152934618.html,10:29AM,Finviz.com,"For the quarter ended on October 31st, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported that revenue grew 8% YoY to $9.44 billion, surpassing LSEG’s consensus estimate of $9.34 billion.
Net income grew 25% YoY to $1.5 billion. Adjusted earnings of $2.41 per share which came short of LSEG’s estimate of $2.44.
Fiscal fourth quarter guidance
Salesforce guided for current quarter sales between $9.9 billion and $10.10 billion and earnings per share in the range between $2.57 and $2.62.
Salesforce ended 2024 on a strong note as it continues its transformation journey.
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff summed up the report as yet another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO, with the AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform being at the heart of its groundbreaking transformation. Salesforce’s Agentforce is an example of so-called AI Agent technology, with such advanced chatbots believed to represent the next step after Microosft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The recently launched Agentforce’ AI software platform or so-called agents stand for advanced generative AI tools that can do multistep, complex tasks on a user’s behalf. Benioff described it as AI agents letting humans unite to transform all customer interactions, allowing human capital to be used where it really makes a difference, such as strategic work. Since Microsof-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a wave of innovation followed. Microsoft alone has also invested billions to develop its own AI products, but there is a lot of of execution ahead, just like for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Google who also touted their efforts to make their AI assistants more productive. Moreover, Benioff even took a hit at Microsoft, saying that its Microsoft Copilot is overhyped, like all LLM-based generative AI assistants, in his effort to shift the conversation towards AI agents that are becoming increasingly important in the new era that is in the making.
All in all, the better than expected revenue and strong outlook fueled hopes for Salesforces much-hyped artificial intelligence strategy coming to fruition. In addition, Seeking Alpha reported that a survey of chief information officers by KeyBanc showed that IT budgets are poised to increase 3.9% YoY in 2025, which would benefit both Salesforce and Microsoft, among other players.

US5949181045,MSFT,Bill Gates Memorized License Plates Of 'Everybody' At Microsoft  Then Checked The Parking Lot To See Who Was Working: 'I Was Quite Fanatical',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-memorized-license-plates-151520951.html,10:15AM,Finviz.com,"When you hold the title ofrichest man in the worldfor 18 years, you will have a few quirks. Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft, may now be known for his philanthropy and thoughtful demeanor. Still, in the early days of building his tech empire, he was something else entirely – a self-described workaholic with an almost obsessive attention to detail.
One of his most surprising habits was memorizing his employees’ license plates so he could monitor their work habits.
Don't Miss:
With 100+ historic trademark victories, this company holds IP for some of the highest-grossing characters in history. Now, they've propelled these icons into the future using next-gen patented AR, VR, and AI technology.There’s now a limited window for investors to claim shares at just $2/share with $980 minimum—but the clock is ticking.
Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target –Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!
Fanatical Leadership, Microsoft-Style
In a 2016 interview with BBC Radio 4, Gates admitted, ""I was quite fanatical about work."" He wasn't exaggerating. The man who rarely took vacations and didn't believe in weekends wasn't just pushing himself – he was also keeping a close watch on everyone else.
""I knew everybody's license plates,"" Gates revealed. ""I could look out in the parking lot and see when did people come in [and] when were they leaving."" This level of micromanagement might sound absurd now, but in the high-pressure world of 1980s Microsoft, it was part of the culture.
Microsoft's cofounder, the late Paul Allen, wrote in a 2011 article for Vanity Fair that Gates's relentless drive defined the company's early years. ""Microsoft was a high-stress environment because Bill drove others as hard as he drove himself,"" Allen recalled. ""He was growing into the taskmaster who would prowl the parking lot on weekends to see who'd made it in.""

The Toll of Intensity
While Gates's intensity helped Microsoft become one of the most successful companies in history, it didn't come without a cost. In Vanity Fair, Allen described how Gates's relentless demands could get under people's skin. Employees were already working grueling hours, but Gates's watchful eye added another layer of stress.
Allen shared the story of Bob Greenberg, a Microsoft employee who worked 81 hours in just four days to meet a project deadline. When Greenberg finally told Gates he planned to take the next day off, Gates responded, ""Why would you want to do that?"" According to Allen, ""He genuinely couldn't understand it. He never seemed to need to recharge.""
The Evolving Gates
Over time, Gates realized that this intense approach wasn't sustainable. During a 2023 commencement speech at Northern Arizona University, he reflected on his early leadership style: ""When I was your age, I didn't believe in vacations. I didn't even believe in weekends. I pushed everyone around me to work very long hours.""
However, Gates said fatherhood and maturity forced him to reassess. ""As I got older – and especiallyonce I became a father –I realized that both in terms of doing your best work and having a great life, that intensity was not always appropriate. Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson.""
Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.
From License Plates to Legacy
While the young Bill Gates might have been a parking lot-patrolling perfectionist, his drive undeniably shaped Microsoft into a tech powerhouse. With decades of reflection and a legacy of leadership, Gates has moved from micromanaging to mentoring.
It's an important reminder that even themost intense leaderscan learn, grow and change – and sometimes, the quirks that seem strangest in hindsight are the very ones that build the foundation for greatness.

Donald Trump has just announced Project Stargate which includes private sector investments in AI infrastructure to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Microsoft will likely be a beneficiary of this as it is a key player in the AI infrastructure and also a partner in the project. Moreover, Microsoft also has a significant stake in OpenAI, a major partner of this initiative.
Wedbush Securities analysts believe this will start a new wave of spending on AI infrastructure.

US5949181045,MSFT,Oracle Takes Run at Clouds Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-takes-run-cloud-big-105554582.html,09:39AM,Finviz.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”
A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two firms — Loop Capital and Jefferies — downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors.
Top Tech Stories
SK Hynix Inc.’s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025.
Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump’s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House.
President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down.
India is trying to pry open the doors of the world’s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country’s smartphones.
An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc.

US5949181045,MSFT,"Microsofts relationship with OpenAI cracked when it hired Mustafa Suleyman, rival Marc Benioff says",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/866ae942-99ff-32ee-9510-a998783e24ba/microsoft%E2%80%99s-relationship-with.html,09:34AM,Finviz.com,"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was literally chuckling when talkingto CNBC from Davosabout the new rift in Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI. As part of OpenAI’s plans to team up with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate, Microsoftis no longer the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI.
“I think it’s extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don’t think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future. They'll have their own frontier models,” Benioff predicted, laughing. “That’s why they hired Mustafa Suleyman. And Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.”
Benioff said their dislike was visible at the year-ago Davos show, “where Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along.”
The end of Microsoft exclusively hosting OpenAI was destined to happen. Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAIin 2019— years before OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Now, OpenAI appears bound for its own tech giant status, perhaps one day to rival Microsoft. OpenAI has alsoblameda lack of available compute for product delays, indicating it needs more data center capacity than Microsoft can (or perhaps wants to) provide. And OpenAI’s exclusive agreement with Microsoft was to end whenever OpenAI achieved whatthey both agreed was AGI.
Some reports indicate tension between the two companies has been building since at least mid-2023, after OpenAI released its own,competing enterprise product. After Altman was fired andreinstated as OpenAI CEOin late 2023, employees from both companies toldBusiness Insiderthey really don’t like working together. OpenAI’s folks tended to look down on those at Microsoft, some employees said.
Just a few months later, in early 2024, Nadella thumbed his nose back by hiring DeepMind and Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to lead Microsoft AI. (Microsoft has not yet responded to our request for comment.)
While Benioff may hope that Microsoft will fully abandon OpenAI in the future, that could be wishful thinking, although Microsoft isreportedlyworking on its own LLM called MAI-1. Still, when Microsoftannouncedearlier this month a new AI group led by Jay Parikh that will build AI agents and apps, the post didn’t even mention OpenAI.
This latest fissure in the partnership is good news for Benioff. Salesforce alsouses OpenAI’s enterprise models, and isan investorin OpenAI rival Anthropic.
Even so, Benioff’s observations about Suleyman aren’t completely off. Suleyman has been known to dismiss Altman’s vision especially around AGI, and admitted last month in an interview withThe Vergethat the OpenAI partnership has “little tensions here and there.”

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Microsoft aims to provide 1 million people in South Africa with artificial intelligence (AI) and cyber security training opportunities by 2026, Lillian Barnard, President for Microsoft Africa, said on Thursday.
Microsoft's (AI) national skilling initiative targets a broad audience, and in South Africa will prioritise all sectors from companies to government and the youth, Barnard said at the company's ""AI Tour"" in Johannesburg.
She did not disclose the investment figure for the initiative.
""By providing skilling opportunities and access to industry recognised certifications, our youth will be well positioned to compete on the global stage,"" Barnard said.
Microsoft, the first global ""hyperscale"" public cloud provider to build data centres in South Africa, has trained four million Africans in the last five years and has committed to train 30 million Africans in the next five years.

US5949181045,MSFT,Where Will AMD Stock Be in 3 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/004f4895-54cf-35c4-9f6c-4b35ea824fd4/where-will-amd-stock-be-in-3.html,09:15AM,Finviz.com,"Stocks have been in a bull market since October 2022. Coincidentally, about a month later in November 2022, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, sparking a generational movement among investors who were chasing anything and everything related to artificial intelligence (AI).
Among opportunities in the AI realm, perhaps none have witnessed more gains thansemiconductor stocks. Since October 2022, theVanEck Semiconductor ETFhas returned 194% -- absolutely dominating theNasdaq Composite's return of 88% and theS&P 500's gain of 68%.
Chief among the chip stocks isNvidia, which has soared by 1,100% since the beginning of the current bull market. By contrast, Nvidia's top rival,Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), has returned 110% over the course of the bull market. This isn't anything to turn your back on, but it's not even in the same league as Nvidia. With that said, I think shares of AMD could be on the brink of their own Nvidia-esque run.
Let's dig into why Nvidia has been all the rage among chip stocks over the last two years and analyze why AMD could be headed much higher over the course of the next few years.
Throughout the AI revolution, Nvidia's bellwether has been its computing and networking business. Specifically, the company's Hopper and Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) have seen historical demand. GPUs are the engine that power generative AI applications. And for much of the last two years, Nvidia was the only major player in town.
As it stands today,Nvidia owns 90% of the GPU market. Although a lead like that might discourage you from even considering an alternative to investing in Nvidia, I would encourage you to keep an open mind.
In December 2023, AMD released the MI300X data center GPU. While this was nearly a year after Nvidia had already been dominating the GPU market, AMD has witnessed some considerable success that I think is going overlooked.
First off, hyperscalers includingMeta Platforms,Oracle, andMicrosoftare all augmenting their Nvidia architecture with AMD's MI300 accelerators. Acquiring customers of this caliber is impressive, but AMD's financial trends are what really have me excited.
Since the release of the MI300 architecture, AMD has seen its data center GPU business grow from effectively nothing into a multibillion-dollar operation, and it has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia's data center operation is actually beginning to show signs of slowing down.
This pace of growth has provided AMD with an estimated 10% share of the GPU market -- effectively making it an outright duel between AMD and Nvidia.
When the current bull market began in October 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was just $280 billion. Today, the company is valued at over $3.3 trillion, more than tenfold what it was worth just two years ago.
Interestingly, AMD's current market cap of $200 billion is not that far away from where Nvidia was valued before it went parabolic. In my eyes, investors are really discounting AMD's potential over the next few years as the company continues scaling up its data center business.
With successor GPUs already scheduled for release between this year and 2026, AMD is in a good position to continue disrupting Nvidia. As such, investors looking for more growth could eventually sour on Nvidia and turn to alternatives such as AMD.
I still see Nvidia as a great opportunity, but I think the days of 1,000%-plus gains are in the rearview mirror. By contrast, I think AMD is in the early stages of its own epic run. I see AMD as a bargain opportunity right now, and I think it will be significantly higher three years from now as its chapter in the AI storyline continues to unfold.

Despite investing almost $14 billion in OpenAI and using the startup’s AI models for its next-generation cloud services, Microsoft was mentioned only as a technology partner in a joint venture called Stargate launched by OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. Then, in a blog post, the software giant said OpenAI could use rival cloud services to train and run its AI models with Microsoft’s permission, watering down an exclusivity contract.
The flurry of announcements prompted renewed speculation that the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship has frayed somewhat, although each party currently has more to gain together than apart. One thing is clear: Over time, Microsoft has become less willing to spend even more money financing the computing power OpenAI requires to retain a lead in artificial intelligence.
In 2023, Microsoft was close to a deal to invest tens of billions of additional dollars in OpenAI, according to people familiar with the situation. At the time, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was talking to Microsoft about helping fund a massive expansion of AI infrastructure with investors in Asia and the Mideast, the people said. Any Microsoft investment would likely have furthered those ambitions.
Then Altman was briefly fired, exposing instability at the heart of OpenAI. Altman was reinstalled as CEO, but the upheaval prompted Microsoft to abandon plans to invest more money, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Altman’s infrastructure plans have since changed several times, but Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had lost enthusiasm for contributing significant sums.
The New York Times previously reported Microsoft’s planned investment in OpenAI.
Microsoft did pump $750 million into OpenAI’s most recent $6.6 billion funding round. But its refusal to make a larger commitment prompted Altman to look for other partners and to chafe against a contractual exclusivity provision that required OpenAI to get all of its cloud capacity from Microsoft through 2030.
Nadella and Altman have had many conversations about the latter’s ambitions to dramatically scale up computing capacity, and Microsoft may invest in an OpenAI infrastructure project, including possibly Stargate, in the future, according to one of the people.
OpenAI needs more computing capacity to fulfill its ambitions, and companies of its current scale don’t generally work with a single partner, according to a person familiar with the situation. The revised deal between OpenAI and Microsoft indicates that the two companies continue to work together closely, the person added.
Microsoft views the revised contract with OpenAI as advantageous, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking. The software giant retains its share of OpenAI’s revenue and is the largest investor in a company that may now become even more valuable — though the size of that stake could change as the startup works to restructure as a for-profit. And Microsoft also still has access to OpenAI models, even if they’re trained in a data center funded by Softbank or Oracle.
The Stargate joint venture and rejiggered partnership with OpenAI also lets Microsoft offload some AI spending onto rivals. That’s a positive development for a company that has pledged to lavish $80 billion this fiscal year on capital expenditures and is monetizing those investments at a slower pace than Wall Street would prefer.
Stargate has already become a lightning rod, with Elon Musk accusing the project’s backers of lacking sufficient funds to pull off their ambitions. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X, hours after the announcement. Later, Musk wrote: “On the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money.”
That prompted a rejoinder from Microsoft’s chief.
“All this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” he wrote on X.

US5949181045,MSFT,Analysis-Britain appeals to Big Tech with change of regulatory guard,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-britain-appeals-big-tech-124932917.html,07:49AM,Finviz.com,"By Paul Sandle, Kate Holton and Andres Gonzalez
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's choice of a former Amazon executive to chair its antitrust regulator is a clear pitch for investment, including from Big Tech, and signals it is prepared to go easier on deal-making if that would help, company bosses and lawyers said.
Doug Gurr, former boss of the U.S. online retailer's UK operation, was picked to chair the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) after Marcus Bokkerink recognised ""it was time to move on"", finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday.
With the economy struggling and pressure building on the government to improve living standards, Reeves wants regulators to change, believing they have become too risk-averse and are preventing companies from innovating and expanding.
Cristina Caffarra, a competition economist who has provided expert analysis for court cases, said mergers did not increase economic output unless big synergies were reinvested.
But the selection of Gurr as chair - on an interim basis for now - indicated Britain was moving closer to U.S. regulation in the hope it would attract investment.
""This is the significance of it,"" she said.
Competition lawyer Dominic Long at A&O Shearman said there could be an increase in cross-border deals for UK assets.
""All things being equal, it will be easier to get potentially problematic deals through now than it would have been, say, 12 months ago,"" he said.
Foreign investment is important in Britain, with the government estimating it created more than 70,000 jobs in fiscal 2023/24. Projects fell after Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union, but the country remains close to France as the top European destination.
However, successive governments have faced criticism from unions and some politicians for making it too easy for foreign companies to buy British ones.
BRUISING ENCOUNTER
The CMA had already made changes under Bokkerink after it took on Microsoft in 2023 only to back down.
It was the only major regulator to block the U.S. tech firm's $69 billion takeover of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard.
But it reversed its decision after a furious Microsoft lobbied the government. The CMA said the U-turn had not been politically influenced. It did not block any big deals in 2024.
One FTSE-100 chief executive, who asked not to be named, said Britain's new Labour government was trying to rebuild ties with Big Tech after the bruising Microsoft encounter.
He said with Donald Trump's new U.S. administration set to give greater leeway to the likes of Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Nvidia, Britain realised it needed to follow suit.
""Given the way the world is going in terms of size and scale of business, we maybe need to look at things in a somewhat different way in the UK,"" he said.
""There's probably a recognition that having more scale is a good thing.""
Martin Sorrell, CEO of ad group S4 Capital and founder of WPP, said the talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos was that Britain - and Europe - had become overly regulated. ""Maybe this is a welcome change in the UK,"" he told Reuters.
TOP TIER
The CMA moved into the top tier of regulators when Britain left the EU in 2020, forcing it to decide whether to align with Brussels, which has issued antitrust charges against Microsoft, Apple and others, or take an often lighter U.S. approach.
Bokkerink said on LinkedIn he had tried to give consumers choice and enable businesses to compete on merit.
Reeves said in Davos on Wednesday that the balance had moved too far on regulating risk.
""You've got to be able to protect consumers but people should also be able to take risks,"" she said.
While the CMA said last year it would focus on ""truly problematic mergers"" and be more open to solutions, it has also stepped up its scrutiny of technology companies in general.
Its Digital Markets Unit is using powers granted this month to investigate Google's search business and on Thursday it launched an investigation into Apple and Google's smartphone operating systems, app stores and browsers.
The CMA is also investigating cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Google echoed the government's growth mantra in its defence of its search business, saying digital services like search would ""power new economic development"" in Britain.
The government denied it was pandering to Big Tech.
""I don't think the characterisation of us being in the pocket of Big Tech is at all accurate,"" Justin Madders, a junior minister in the business department, told parliament on Wednesday.
Amelia Fletcher, professor of competition policy at Norwich Business School and a former non-executive director of the CMA, said she would be ""very concerned"" if the government weakened the CMA's ability to regulate digital markets.
""I fear that Big Tech is framing this new regulation as anti-growth, when it is specifically designed to promote growth,"" she said.
""It is designed to open up markets to new competition and innovation, and to ensure that businesses using digital platforms can compete effectively.
""I would urge the CMA to remain firm.""

It allows you to zoom out on the world and gives you perspective on the big things happening. Buying and holding the top companies behind the world's growth trends can be a reliable path to building wealth, perhaps even beating the broader stock market.
Technology is central to today's world, as innovation drives progress in fast-growing fields such asartificial intelligence, cloud computing, robotics, software, and more.
If you want a portfolio that will stand the test of time and grow at the pace of innovation, consider buying and holding these top five technology stocks for the next decade. This isn't about specifics; think about what each company already does and, more importantly, where it's heading.
In other words, the big picture.
AI chip leaderNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)is a no-brainer for any long-term tech investor. The company should enjoy years of continued growth, with the AI chip market projected to grow 20% annually to over $300 billion by 2029. However, emerging opportunities to expand into new AI applications should excite investors the most.
Nvidia recently announced a new AI supercomputer that is small enough for individual developers. The company's focus on expanding beyond data center products could make it a player in additional end markets, such as robotics, over the coming decade.
Google's parent company,Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), is a one-stop shop for innovation. The company's highly profitable Google brand (search engine and software ecosystem) has built one of the world's finest companies. However, it has several promising irons in the fire, with ongoing developments in nascent technologies, including self-driving vehicles (Waymo) and quantum computing (Google Quantum AI).
In addition, Alphabet operates the third-largest cloud platform (Google Cloud), has in-house AI models (Gemini), and accesses a mountain of first-party data from Google users to train its AI with. Thus, Alphabet might be better suited for the next decade of growth than any other ""Magnificent Seven"" stock.
Streaming pioneerNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX)continues to lead a streaming field that has become increasingly crowded with competition over the past five years. Netflix has become a global juggernaut with approximately 283 million paid memberships. Highly popular content, such asSquid Game, underlines its ability to appeal across cultures and geographic markets.
Investing in Netflix for the next decade involves multiple growth levers that the company is only beginning to pull. After operating solely on a subscription model for years, Netflix has started integrating advertising into its business. In recent years, Netflix has expanded its content universe, branching into mobile gaming and live sports. Look for Netflix to lean further into these new categories (and monetize them) over the next decade.
E-commerce giantAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)is known primarily as the online retail leader in America. It's true that Amazon accounts for approximately 40% of U.S. e-commerce sales. However, e-commerce accounts for only about 16% of retail spending, meaning Amazon's legacy business can still drive future growth. Yet Amazon goes far beyond e-commerce. The company operates the world's largest cloud computing platform (AWS), which accounts for over 30% of the global market.
Amazon built a consumer-facing ecosystem on Prime memberships, which total over 200 million today. It has launched new businesses within that ecosystem, including a telehealth platform, video streaming service, and smart home devices (Alexa). The company's digital advertising unit isblossoming into a key contributor. Amazon's ability to enter new industries makes it an obvious investment for the next decade and probably beyond.
Technology behemothMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)has also shown it can continually launch and nurture new businesses. It rose to prominence over 30 years ago with Windows personal computer software. Today, Windows remains relevant, but the company boasts a sprawling software empire that includes Windows, Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.), Microsoft Dynamics 365, Xbox (which owns three major game publishers), GitHub (developer platform), and more.
Microsoft's software is ingrained in millions of business and consumer devices worldwide. It's a wide moat and distribution network for new products. Additionally, Microsoft operates Azure, the world's second-largest cloud platform. The company is among the most aggressive AI hyperscalers investing in AI capabilities, tying Azure to a cloud services industry that could grow by 16% annually to over $2.7 trillion by 2034 on AI tailwinds.

OpenAI chief Sam Altmansays he's changed his perspective on Donald Trump amid an online spat with the new U.S. president's""first buddy,"" Elon Musk.
In a post onX,Altman said:""Watching @potus more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him. I wish I had done more of my own thinking and definitely fell in the npc [non-playable character] trap. I'm not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!""
The comments came amid a flurry of online exchanges between Musk, Altman, andMicrosoftover the$500 billion Stargate Projectannounced by Trump on Tuesday.
Musk kicked off the debate by accusingOpenAI and SoftBankof not having the money for the ambitious AI infrastructure project. The billionaire said in a post on X he had it on ""good authority"" that SoftBank ""has well under $10B secured.""
OpenAI has said the joint venture will invest an initial $100 billion of private capital to fund the U.S. AI infrastructure, with a further $400 billion expected over the next four years, but Musk isn't the only one to question the project's eye-watering finances.
Some have pointed to SoftBank's most recent public finances as a potential problem.
Earlier this year,SoftBank Grouponlyhad $30 billion in cash—a far cry from the $100 billion promised. Masayoshi Son's firm has also taken a reputational hit from a few bad bets, most notably its backing of bankrupt co-working firmWeWork.
Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have attempted to silence some of the questions surrounding the project's funding. The OpenAI chief responded to Musk's comment, saying he was ""wrong as you surely know.""
""This is great for the country,"" Altman continued. ""I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put [the U.S.] first.""
In response to a later post, Altman upped the ante, saying that while herespected Musk's ambition,he didn't think theTeslaCEO was a nice person or treating OpenAI fairly.
Musk lobbed a series of posts back at the OpenAI chief, bringing up old anti-Trump tweets, slamming him for his connection with Democrat donor Reid Hoffman, reigniting an ongoing feud over OpenAI's profit structure—in whichhe called Altman a ""liar""—and criticizingOpenAI's partnershipwith media outlet Axios.
Microsoft's Nadella also waded into the debate over the Stargate Project's funding, telling CNBC he was ""good"" for his $80 billion contribution.
The Microsoft CEO also replied to a post from Musk on X, saying: ""And all this money is not about hyping AI, but about building useful things for the real world!""
It's not the first time Altman and Musk have publicly sparred with each other online.
The pair have a history that goes back to OpenAI's early days.
Altman and Musk, along with nine others, were cofounders of the AI lab and worked together at the company until Musk stepped down from the board of directors in early 2018.
Altman and other OpenAI executives claim Musk had been trying to merge OpenAI with Tesla, but when this was unsuccessful, he chose to leave to build an AGI competitor within Tesla.
In response, Musk has railed against OpenAI's corporate structure, accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit roots for the sake of its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft.
Representatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to a request for comment fromFortune.

US5949181045,MSFT,Microsoft Stock Investors: 1 Very Important Artificial Intelligence (AI) Number to Watch Next Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b3e2bb5f-f9da-378e-b007-2060c6694b9b/microsoft-stock-investors%3A-1.html,04:58AM,Finviz.com,"A new quarterly earnings season is now underway in corporate America. Next week, we will hear from some of the ""Magnificent Seven"" technology companies, which collectively represent almost one-third of the value of the entireS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Wall Street will be particularly focused on their progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, because that could be a big source of their future earnings.
On Jan. 29,Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)will report results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. Investors will be paying a great deal of attention to how well the company is monetizing its growing portfolio of AI products and services, but there is one number that could be more important than the rest.
Microsoft has made huge investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and it has used the start-up's technology to fuel its own AI ambitions. For example, OpenAI's models form part of the foundation of Microsoft's Copilot virtual assistants, which are now embedded for free in flagship software products like the Windows operating system, the Bing search engine, the Edge internet browser, and more.
Subscribers to Microsoft's 365 productivity suite can also add Copilot to their plans for an additional monthly fee, allowing them to rapidly generate text and images in apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Organizations around the world pay for more than 400 million 365 licenses for their employees, and all of them are potential subscribers to Copilot.
During the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, Microsoft said 70% of the Fortune 500 were using Copilot for 365 already, and the number of people using it daily had more than doubled from three months earlier. Investors should keep an eye out for further updates next week, because this could be a major source of new revenue for Microsoft.
But details about the Azure cloud platform will likely headline Microsoft's quarterly report once again, and Azure AI will be a big reason why. Azure has become a preferred platform for businesses seeking to deploy AI because it offers them computing power viastate-of-the-art data centers, and ready-made large language models (LLMs) from leading third-party providers like OpenAI. Those are two of the key ingredients required to build AI software.
Azure has regularly been the fastest-growing segment of Microsoft's entire organization. During the fiscal first quarter, its revenue jumped by 33% year over year -- more than double Microsoft's overall revenue growth rate of 16%.
Azure AI is becoming an important contributor to Azure's overall growth. It was responsible for 12 percentage points of Azure's 33% revenue growth during the first quarter, which was a record high. In the year-ago period, Azure AI contributed just 5 percentage points to Azure's top-line result.
Microsoft allocated $20 billion to capital expenditures during the fiscal 2025 first quarter, most of which went toward building AI-capable data centers. That followed a staggering $55.7 billion in capex during fiscal 2024.
The revenue generated by Azure AI is one way for investors to measure the return Microsoft is seeing on that enormous spending. For example, if Azure AI continues to contribute an increasing amount of Azure's growth, then it's a positive indication that businesses are ramping up their spending on AI processing capacity and LLMs.
Microsoft stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.4, which is a 7.5% premium to its 10-year average of 32.9. It's also a premium to the tech-heavyNasdaq-100index, which includes Microsoft's big-tech peers and currently has a P/E ratio of 32.5.
In other words, Microsoft stock isn't cheap right now. Its massive spending on AI infrastructure is taking a bite out of its earnings, so investors might be hesitant to support its elevated valuation if they aren't seeing clear benefits from those outlays each quarter.
For example, if Azure AI's contribution to Azure's growth begins to decline, that could flip investor sentiment on its head and trigger a correction in Microsoft stock. That's why I think it's the single most important number for investors to watch on Jan. 29.

US0378331005,AAPL,DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-sell-off-reminds-investors-of-the-biggest-earnings-story-holding-up-the-stock-market-141101978.html,Yahoo Finance•1 hour ago,Yahoo Finance,"Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not onlywhat's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.
New developmentsfrom Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.
Nvidia stock dropped more than than 11%. Meanwhile fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more in early trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.
""When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief investment strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. ""That’s exactly what we’re seeing today.""
A slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With withindex valuations near multi-decade highsand the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.
But unlike other risks likehigher interest ratesorsticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.
In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead,causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the ""Magnificent Seven"" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.
As Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""

US0378331005,AAPL,"Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-are-coming-and-trump-will-be-top-of-mind-for-investors-154048872.html,Yahoo Finance•3 days ago,Yahoo Finance,"Big Tech’s earnings season kicks off this week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry’s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well underway and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new artificial intelligence models.
And looming over all of that will be how newly inaugurated President Trump will impact tech’s biggest trend in years. Whether it’s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies’ bottom lines.
Trump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday,announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the US. And on Thursday, Trumpsigned an executive orderaimed at ensuring US dominance in AI.
It’s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.
Investors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don’t end up on the wrong end of Trump’s proposedtariffs on goods from China.
Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG,GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.
There’s also the fate of the CHIPS Act. The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chipmakers, saying it was “so bad” during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election.
Without the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chipmaking facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it’s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.
In addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.
During its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn’t enough to satisfy investors,sending the company’s stock sinking 5%the day after the report.
Meta’s stock suffered a similar setbackfollowing its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 capital expenditures would increase from $37 billion-$40 billion to $38 billion-$40 billion.
Google and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.
Microsoft shares are up around 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC), which has risen 26% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 52% and 35%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 66%.
One of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.
If Trump and TikTok can’t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn but competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.
But with Trump proclaiming that he’d “save” TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Enhances App Store Tools as iOS 18 Adoption Surges,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-enhances-app-store-tools-141137701.html,GuruFocus.com•1 hour ago,Yahoo Finance,"Apple (AAPL,Financials)announcedmajor updates to its App Store platform, aimed at providing developers with enhanced tools for app management and improving the overall user experience.
These changes coincide with the period of time when Apple's most recent operating systems are being adopted at hitherto unprecedented rates.
Reflecting great customer acceptance of the newest software, 76 percent of new iPhones produced in the previous four years run iOS 18 as of January 21, 2025. iOS 18 is loaded on 68 percent of iPhones on active devices; 19 percent remain on iOS 17 and 5 percent utilize prior versions. Likewise, 63 percent of freshly launched iPads run on iPadOS 18; 53 percent of all active iPads run on the most recent version.
Apple's tool for app administration, App Store Connect, lets developers upload, publish, and oversee their apps more quickly. Improved sales and download tracking, complete financial management capabilities, and simplified procedures for app testing and in-app purchase administration constitute new features.
Apple has redesigned its App Review process to enhance developer success and provide a safer and more reliable surroundings for consumers. The new method provides better rules to assist developers in preparing their entries and solves typical causes of app rejections. The update also has a simpler appeals procedure for developers trying to get deleted applications back on line.
Apart from administration tools, Apple has included fresh business and marketing insights to support developers in raising app discoverability and user interaction. These tools include techniques for creating successful product pages, using pre-orders, and best using in-app purchasing capabilities. Deeper understanding of user behavior made possible by improved analytics helps developers to customize onboarding experiences and react more successfully to user evaluations.
These improvements, according to industry observers, would not only simplify the app creation process but also help Apple's position in the cutthroat app business to be strengthened. Apple wants to draw more developers to its platform by offering strong support and cutting-edge tools thus promoting creativity and increasing the spectrum of accessible apps for consumers.
Apple's constant investment in the App Store ecosystem emphasizes its will to maintain a safe and vibrant market, thereby assuring that both customers and developers benefit from a flawless and quick app experience.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-strengthening-ai-132339230.html,Insider Monkey•2 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.
The moment of reckoning has arrived: China’s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US’s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump’s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.
When he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden’s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to “make America the world capital in artificial intelligence”.

The President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The “Stargate initiative” will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow “people with a lot of money” to invest in so-called “AI plants” that power data centers for artificial intelligence.
Trump’s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world’s first reasoning model, o1, which used a “chain of thought” to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called “Gemini Flash Thinking” in December and a few days later, o3 was born.
Keeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.
Third-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek’s model outperformed Meta’s Llama 3.1, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn’t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI’s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.
“To see the DeepSeek new model, it’s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously”.
DeepSeek’s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia’s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump’s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm’s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a “strong report” from Apple due to the iPhone 16’s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple’s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.
“Partly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features, which we see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),” Mohan wrote.
Overall, AAPLranks 2ndon our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

US0378331005,AAPL,"Morning Bid: AI, aye, aye",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-ai-aye-aye-110322809.html,Reuters•4 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Amanda Cooper, Finance and Markets Breaking News Editor, Europe.
Stocks are getting hammered on Monday, with hefty declines in the technology sector as artificial intelligence big guns like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel took a dive.
The trigger was a burst of hype around the launch last week of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI rival to ChatGPT. Not only is DeepSeek's app now top of the leaderboard on the Apple Store in terms of downloads, online searches for ""DeepSeek"" have exploded in the last 7 days, while those for its larger competitor have remained stagnant.
With four out of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" due to report earnings this week, the rise of DeepSeek as a possible alternative to Western-led AI has served as a dose of reality.
Investors have been willing to shell out for these stocks' sky-high valuations on their promises to deliver juicy returns with their investments in AI.
The Magnificent Seven, a group comprising Wall Street's biggest companies by market capitalisation that includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Facebook parent Meta, now account for a third of global market value, compared with around a fifth two years ago, according to asset manager Federated Hermes.
DeepSeek rolled out an open-source reasoning model called DeepSeek-R1 on Monday that it said rivalled OpenAI's o1 on several performance benchmarks. Tests last month on its V3 large language model outperformed those of OpenAI and Meta, with a smaller development budget and plans to charge users a lot less.
OpenAI kicked off the race in AI development after it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. But it was Nvidia, whose supercomputing chips power a lot of AI applications, that really ignited the rally in the stock market when it delivered bumper earnings in May 2023 that sent its valuation soaring above $1 trillion.
Since then, Nvidia shares have risen by 250%. Investors have been happy to let its Mag-7 companions ride higher on its coattails, but only to a point. Apple shares are up just 26% in that time, while Microsoft is up 34%. Meta has been a bigger winner since then, up 145%.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week unveiled a plan for private-sector investment of $500 billion in AI infrastructure aimed at outpacing rival nations. Oracle, one of the companies involved in the joint venture, along with Japan's SoftBank and OpenAI, saw its shares jump 7% and the second-biggest daily traded volume in its stock in a year.
Slower roll-outs of AI applications, higher costs and other hiccups have tested investors' faith in Wall Street's dominant players in the sector, but have not curbed their enthusiasm.
Now, competitors are starting to snap at their heels.
China's ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, last week released an update to its flagship AI model - a direct challenger to OpenAI - while in the world of smartphones, Samsung last week unveiled its newest Galaxy S25 smartphones, powered by Qualcomm's chips and Google's AI model, which it hopes can help pump up sales and fend off both Apple and Chinese rivals.
Apple, Microsoft and Meta will report quarterly results this week, along with electric car maker Tesla.
Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:
* Super Micro Computer Q2 earnings
* 2- and 5-year U.S. Treasury auctions

US0378331005,AAPL,Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-berkshire-hathaway-stock-jan-104100451.html,Motley Fool•4 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"To say thatBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than theS&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.
There could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?
You might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.
However, another companywillreport its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 --Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of newgenerative AIfeatures available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.
Why does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.
Berkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?
Over the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.
Could Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.
For example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1stock splitthat excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.
On Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.
So should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?
There's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.
That appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.
Analysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.
Despite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.
I don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.

US0378331005,AAPL,"1 Market-Beating ETF That Doesn't Have Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple Among Its Top 3 Holdings",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-market-beating-etf-doesnt-100400249.html,Motley Fool•5 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"Many top exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have been outperforming theS&P 500in recent years all have a common theme, which is that their top three holdings usually include at least one of the following tech stocks:Nvidia,Microsoft, orApple.
There's nothing wrong with those stocks, as they give investors exposure to some fantastic companies, but their high valuations could make investors hesitant about investing in funds that are so dependent on them. If there's a correction in the market, particularly in tech, those three stocks may be particularly vulnerable.
For investors who want to focus ongrowth stocksbut don't want heavy exposure to those three tech giants, one ETF you may want to consider isAmerican Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: QGRO). Here's a closer look at the fund, and why it could make for a fantastic long-term investment.
The American Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF holds 200 stocks in its portfolio, with a weighted average market cap of around $407 billion. The fund's top three holdings areNetflix,Booking Holdings, andTJX Companies. And none of those three stocks individually account for even 4% of the ETF's total weight. Its top 10 stocks, in total, represent a fairly modest 29% of American Century's total portfolio. That's great diversification for investors as it reduces the risk that one or even a few poor-performing stocks could sink the fund.
Tech stocks still play an important role in its performance, however, making up 37% of the ETF's holdings. But without heavy exposure to any individual stock, that can make American Century a much more attractive option for growth investors. You're still getting exposure to many great tech stocks, but that diversification can help reduce your overall risk. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple are all within the fund's portfolio but together, they represent just 3.8% of its total weight.
Other sectors that are key components of the ETF include consumer discretionary, which accounts for 16% of its holdings, followed by industrials at 11%, and communication services at 10% -- the last one to be in the double digits.
The American Century ETF has only been around since 2018 and so it doesn't have a long track record. But over the past five years, it has easily outperformed the S&P 500, without having to rely heavily on a select few tech stocks. That's an impressive performance and speaks to the quality of the growth stocks it contains in its portfolio.
The fund has anexpense ratioof 0.29%, which is a bit higher than other ETFs, but it's still fairly low overall. And I believe it's justifiable given the more balanced growth option it provides investors.
As well as the fund has performed of late, American Century can potentially remain a market-beating ETF in the years ahead due to its diversification. Its safer mix of growth stocks can position investors to benefit from the market's long-term gains without having to worry about a few stocks that could derail its performance.
For investors who want a fund that isn't as dependent on the three most valuable stocks in the world, this ETF can be a great option to add to your portfolio right now and hang on to for the long haul.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

US0378331005,AAPL,Wall Street Options Pros Play It Cool Before Key Earnings Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-options-pros-play-100000305.html,Bloomberg•5 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"(Bloomberg) -- Options traders are keeping calm ahead of this quarter’s biggest week of earnings.

Companies representing more than 30% of the Russell 1000 Index’s market value are expected to report this week, including technology and energy giants from Apple Inc. to Exxon Mobil Corp. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision Wednesday, while Donald Trump is issuing executive orders and pronouncements on everything from interest rates to oil prices.
Despite all that, traders are showing little appetite to hedge against sudden swings in share prices. That’s partly because stocks hit record highs last week amid optimism that inflation will keep slowing and signals that Trump may temper some of his campaign-trail talk around higher tariffs. The Cboe Volatility Index sank to this year’s low, signaling a big shift in sentiment from late 2024, when traders were increasingly concerned about the path of interest-rate cuts by the Fed and potential Trump administration policies.
“The market is relatively risk-tolerant and looks like everybody is on a good mood,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Most of the positioning so far is not showing a tremendous bias one way or the other.”
One broad measure illustrates the market calm. The put-call ratio across US stocks is near multi-year lows, indicating a decline in demand for downside protection.
“That’s a decent indicator of what clients are thinking as far as owning more upside into the big-cap tech earnings, especially after Netflix results,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler. “Outside Apple, the sentiment is pretty optimistic.”
Take Meta Platforms Inc. Options are implying a 6.7% move in the session after it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would lag the average 11% fluctuation following the past eight results. The put skew also shows that traders are far less risk averse now than before the last release, when it was much steeper.
Microsoft Corp. has a similar pattern: Its skew has flattened, signaling that traders are not betting on big stock moves in either direction. Tesla Inc., whose 7.7% expected swing pales next to its 12% average fluctuation following past results, has a call skew as traders shifted their wagers after Trump’s election to favor further gains in the stock.
Apple options are implying a bigger move than what was realized in the past. Yet its skew, which has been steeper than most of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants since the middle of 2024, has narrowed in recent weeks. While traders have become more cautious after the stock received a pair of analyst downgrades, the lack of upside positioning in the shares creates more room for a positive surprise.
Of the biggest companies reporting earnings this week that have active options trading, most are implying smaller fluctuations than realized on average in the session following the past eight quarterly reports. Options on Apple and semiconductor company Lam Research Corp. appear to be the most overpriced, while those on Meta and Tesla are underpriced.
Outside of tech, Exxon and Chevron Corp. lead oil major earnings late in the week. Options are pricing little difference between the expected stock swing and past moves. While oil futures slipped last week, with Trump urging OPEC to lower the price of crude, there appeared to be little shift in positioning among the producers.
Overall, the options market expects earnings volatility this quarter to be below the three-year average fluctuations in the day following past results and well below last quarter’s realized moves, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s global quantitative and derivatives strategy team.
“The average implied moves are the lowest going into earnings since the 4Q23 earnings season,” strategists including JPMorgan Daniel Motoc wrote in a note.

US0378331005,AAPL,Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-stock-warren-buffett-utmost-095100117.html,Motley Fool•5 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"WhenBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.
Buffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, helays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Streetand keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.
But when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.
Logic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.
Tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).
However, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.
Credit-services providerAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP)has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. ""AmEx,"" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an ""indefinite"" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.
Yet it's been alongtime since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.
Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding,Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.
But since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.
Interestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filedForm 13Fswith the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.
Rather, detailed purchasing activity of this ""favorite stock"" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in isshares of his own company.
However, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.
On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.
Even though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.
Aside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.
For one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.
The other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.
With Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.

US0378331005,AAPL,Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘We Sold Some Stock Because It Became Too Big A Part Of Our Portfolio’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-apple-inc-aapl-165044126.html,Insider Monkey•22 hours ago,Yahoo Finance,"We recently published an article titledJim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
In his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, ""If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies."" According to him, ""These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation"" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.
Commenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, ""Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?"" This means wondering where he is ""in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department."" Cramer believes that Musk ""doesn't seem to have them"" and added, ""If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.""
The CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to ""forget healthcare."" He believes ""Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.""
Cramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, ""Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room."" Cramer believes ""there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on."" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. ""And I'm not a small cap aficionado,"" Cramer commented. He believes, ""That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative."" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes ""companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.""
As for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:
""The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.""
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:
""I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.""
Overall AAPLranks 3rdon our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.
Source: Investing.com
AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0378331005,AAPL,Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/not-all-companies-are-backing-away-from-dei-in-the-new-trump-era-140137635.html,Yahoo Finance•yesterday,Yahoo Finance,"Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era — successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.
The giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from itsdiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)practices.
The measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.
""Our position on these issues is not new,"" Costco’s board chairman Tony James said about the company’s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.
""We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,” James added.
An NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.
""While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,"" saidStefan Padfield, NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project executive director.
Many prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to ""combat illegal private sector DEI actions.""
“My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,” Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Over the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe’s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.
Many of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.
But Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.
""Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,"" the company said in its proxy statement.
Some big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according toa report in the Wall Street Journal.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.
""Bring them on,"" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI duringan interview with CNBClast week in Davos.
""We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.""

There aren't anysecrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.
We can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 millionApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.
Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.
Buffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top ofBerkshire's portfolioif he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.
Berkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.
Trailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.
A mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.
Investors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.
Apple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.
Fiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue. While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.
The bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.
Apple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $369,816!*
Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $42,191!*
Netflix:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004,you’d have $527,206!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

US0378331005,AAPL,4 stocks whose earnings will rock markets this week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-whose-earnings-rock-132220023.html,TheStreet•yesterday,Yahoo Finance,"It's been a big week for markets. Donald Trump was sworn in as President for a second term, promising economic and market growth, deportations and tariffs.
Once markets reopened after the Martin Luther King holiday, the result was a solid one for stocks. The S&P 500 added 1.7% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.65%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.2%.

January is turning into a strong month. The Dow, up 4.4% going into the last week of trading, is off to its best start since 2019. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with gains of 3.7% and 3.3% in January, respectively, are enjoying their best starts since 2023.
Part of the gains are due to the Trump rally. Measured from the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 is up 5.5%. The Nasdaq has jumped 8.2%, and the Dow has risen 5.2%. The Nasdaq-100 Index, which includes all of the big technology stocks and a lot of growthy stocks, is up 7.7%.

The week ahead brings us one of the most important weeks of any earnings season. A total of 349 companies are due to report quarterly reports.
What sets the week apart is who's reporting.
It includes a bevy of giant tech stocks, including four of the seven Magnificent 7 companies — Apple(AAPL), Meta Platforms(META), Microsoft(MSFT)and Tesla(TSLA).
They are joined by such giants as AT&T(T), Boeing(BA), Starbucks SBUX, money manager Blackstone(BX), personal finance giant(SOFI), Caterpillar(CAT)and Sherwin Williams(SHW).

Toward the end of the week, the energy sector of the S&P 500 starts to weigh in, starting with Shell(RYDBF)and Baker Hughes(BKR)on Thursday and, on Friday, the giants: Exxon Mobil(XOM)and Chevron(CVX).
Around the first four companies are a host of questions, all different, that investors might consider:
Apple's economic power is built on the overwhelming success of the iPhone since its introduction in 2007. So, slowing sales may be a surprise to some. The shares, however, are down 11% since Dec. 31 after jumping 30.1% in 2024. The iPhone 16 is a concern because it has not been the huge success Apple and its investors expected.
Related: Analysts set surprising price targets for Apple before earnings
Other issues are slow sales in China and problems getting enough artificial intelligence features into the iPhone. Much of that may be fixed when the iPhone 17 comes out. It's due in September. One other challenge for all cell-phone companies: Mobile telephony is getting to be a mature market.
The rap on Apple right now is that it isn't innovating enough. There is no gotta-have product coming right now.
But its elements, starting with a $3.35-trillion market cap, the strength of the iPhone franchise and its Apple store, give the company so much power and time to fix problems, that no analyst dares to rate it a sell.
The consensus on Apple earnings is $2.34 a share, up from $2.18 a share. The revenue estimate is $124 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago.
The stock of the Facebook parent is up 10.6% this year after a 65% gain in 2024. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has become friendly with the Trump Administration, but the company never seems to make critics happy.
Related: Analyst revisits Meta stock price target as Zuckerberg drops bombshell
On the other hand, the company has a market cap of $1.64 trillion. The ad business is very strong, and Meta employs artificial intelligence to deliver ads of interest to increasingly specific groups of users.
There are some risks: Reliance on advertising is a big one. Another is big: How much further can it grow its audience.
Meta's fourth-quarter earnings estimates are $7.29 a share on revenue of $47 billion. If this were the case, earnings would be up 26.6%, and revenue would jump 17.1%.
Microsoft shares have been a bit of a laggard, partly because of its huge bet on artificial intelligence. They were up nearly 57% in 2023 as the AI frenzy took off. But they were up 12.1% in 2024. So far, in January, the stock has been up 5.35%.
Related: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025
Investors have been a bit nervous seeing the company spend $80 billion a quarter to build out AI.  But 52 of 57 analysts who cover the stock rate it a buy or strong buy. Only five say it's a hold. The market cap is $3.3 trillion.
But the company believes all will be visible when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Earnings for the fiscal second quarter are estimated at $3.11 a share, up from $2.93 a year ago. Revenue is expected to jump 11% to $68.8 billion.
Look for continued profits from its Microsoft Office products. A major portion of revenue comes from customers simply renewing their licenses.

Tesla shares are down 4.7% in January after a 62% gain in 2024. The annual return came after the shares fell more than 56% in the first quarter of 2024 because of worries Tesla's sales were falling.
The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is 77 cents a share, up 8.4% from a year ago. Revenue of $27.1 billion would be up 7.8%.
A challenge for the company is its inability to come up with a moderately priced vehicle for the U.S. market. While Tesla has intense fans, they are mostly moderate to affluent buyers.
Related: Elon Musk, Sam Altman brawl over major AI deal
At the same time, CEO Elon Musk hates his company being called a car company. He believes Tesla is really an artificial intelligence company. One reason: every Tesla vehicle communicates where and how it is is being driven, Tesla collects all that data to improve vehicles and driving experience and improve the software that drives them.
There is hope the company will introduce a sport utility vehicle this year. And Musk is promising to bring a Robo Taxi to market perhaps this year.
The solar battery business is, apparently, solid.
One question that may get asked in the earnings call is how Musk can do two full-time jobs at once: running Tesla and working with the Trump Administration to cut federal spending.
Note:The three remaining Mag 7 stocks are Google-parent Alphabet(GOOGL)and Amazon.com(AMZN), due Feb. 6, and Nvidia(NVDA), due Feb. 26.

InvestingProsubscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!
Monday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day
Apple
What happened?On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.
*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.
What’s the full story?Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.
Jefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.
The AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.
Ford
What happened?On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.
*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.
What’s the full story?Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.
While cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.
Veeva Systems
What happened?On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.
*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.
What’s the full story?Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva’s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.
Additionally, Veeva’s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.
Goldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.
Twilio
What happened?On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.
*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.
What’s the full story?Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.
Acknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

AAPL was headed lower, since the support at 435 was too weak and had no historical signficance. Last week, AAPL broke through this level and appears to be headed lower towards more defined support.AAPL has some support at 419.70 which is the purple line the weekly chart, but this still isn’t the strongest support level. A more clearly defined support is at 404, then further down at 365. Another potential target is 10% lower, which is the measured move (the high of 483.53 and the low of 434.96) of thelatest chart pattern breakdown; this would put AAPL at 390.00. Ultimately things look bearish for AAPL: we have a death cross, a well established downtrend and continued selling enough to break support.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.
Source: Investing.com
AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

AAPL was headed lower, since the support at 435 was too weak and had no historical signficance. Last week, AAPL broke through this level and appears to be headed lower towards more defined support.AAPL has some support at 419.70 which is the purple line the weekly chart, but this still isn’t the strongest support level. A more clearly defined support is at 404, then further down at 365. Another potential target is 10% lower, which is the measured move (the high of 483.53 and the low of 434.96) of thelatest chart pattern breakdown; this would put AAPL at 390.00. Ultimately things look bearish for AAPL: we have a death cross, a well established downtrend and continued selling enough to break support.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavyNasdaqclimbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0378331005,AAPL,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Furthermore, all six companies are currently trading above their calculated fair values. Tesla shows the largest fair value gap at -25.5% and Microsoft is closest to its fair value with just -2.8% difference.
Note: Financial Health Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating stronger financial health.
With these tech giants holding significant weight in major indices, their results will undoubtedly influence broader market trends.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

US0378331005,AAPL,Beware Rotation: Top S&P 500 Giants Underperform Amid Market Shifts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beware-rotation-top-sp-500-giants-underperform-amid-market-shifts-200656376,"Jan 17, 2025",Investing.com,"Here’s a chart of the Top 10S&P 500names (by market cap) and how the stocks have performed YTD through January 15, ’25, relative to the S&P 500 total return:

Source: Ycharts
None of the top 3 names by market cap, i.e. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are beating the S&P 500 YTD. (Apple had a very tough day yesterday, January 16th, ’25, as Apple and the QQQ’s fell 3.5% and 4% respectively. )
Here’s how the Top 10 names by market cap rank in terms of YTD ’25 performance, best to worst:
Source: Ycharts, as of Thursday close, January 15, ’25
What’s interesting to me is that the top 3 market-cap weights and the largest 3 names in the S&P 500 by market cap weight are down the most YTD in ’25. As of last night’s close that is 19% – 20% of the S&P 500’s market cap weight, and 25% – 26% of the QQQ’s market cap weight.
As readers can probably surmise, you should watch for “rotation”, or the move out of large-cap growth and large-cap tech, into the other asset classes, like mid-cap and small-cap (whether growth or value, it won’t matter), and international too.

The above spreadsheet is this blog’s annual returns for the various asset classes, which is updated to track the potential rotation, from large-cap growth to the other equity asset classes.
As of the end of ’24, there isn’t hard evidence of a rotation yet.
The style-box returns are just as they have been for the secular bull market that started either March 9, 2009 or on January 1, 2010.
It’s likely we will need to see Q4 ’24 earnings and guidance for the S&P 500 Top 10 names to see if there’s any material difference in expectations.
This blog has been cautious since last summer on the AI frenzy and the Nvidia / semiconductor trade, which might have been premature. Taiwan Semi had a good quarter this week, with better-than-expected revenue guidance. Micron’s stock is holding up well, despite horrid guidance and estimate revisions.
Here’s this blog’s top 10 holdings for clients as of 12/31/24:
The majority of clients have balanced accounts under some form of the 60% / 40% asset allocation, with this blog adjusting the equity / fixed income based on market conditions.
The JP Morgan Income Fund (JMSIX) beat the Barclays (LON:BARC) Aggregate in 2024 by around 650 bp’s in ’24. That’s the “credit over duration” trade, that lasts only as long as the US economy stays healthy.
The biggest single position change was the reduction in Microsoft’s weight in the 3rd quarter ’24. It’s spending a lot of money on AI capex, and the CoPilot launch seemed to be received in a luke-warm fashion. Satya Nadella did a fantastic job with the cloud and Azure, but I worry the AI transition might not go as smoothly.
Some larger clients have 100% equity portfolios, that have a big influence on the Top 10 holdings.
Many of these positions have been held for years.
The last Top 10 holdings posted was way back in early July ’24, when this blog turned more cautious on the large-cap growth trade, but large-cap and growth still performed well in full-year ’24.
I was surprised looking at the style box and the difference in large-cap growth and value in the 2nd half of ’24. Large-cap value didn’t hold up all that well in back half of ’24.
Everything about this post-Covid rally in US stocks has been dominated by AI, Nvidia and semiconductors, and personally Im staying away from that trade, with the exception of smaller trades in larger accounts.
Within most clients balanced accounts, the financial sector is the largest overweight relative to the S&P 500’s financial sector weight of 13%, thus that turned out to be a big winner in late ’24. Some small amounts of JP Morgan are being trimmed in early ’25, while the stocks like Schwab (SCHW) and the KRE (regional bank ETF), should win with a steeper yield curve, and remain below their 2021 high prints.

The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.comFed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocksset to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.

META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.

AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0378331005,AAPL,Gold: Overbought Conditions May Spark Profit-Taking With Fed on the Horizon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-overbought-conditions-may-spark-profittaking-with-fed-on-the-horizon-200656645,Unknown,Investing.com,"Goldfell in Asia trade as thedollarrebounded on the back of concerns about US technology stocks as DeepSeek’s budget model raised questions about the need for huge AI investment. The weakness comes after the precious metal closed higher for the fourth week in a row but came just shy of reaching the October 2024 record high of $2790 on Friday.
Last week’s price action across financial markets suggests there was perhaps a reduction in safe-haven demand. This was offset however by increased fears ofinflationrisks, while a weakerUS dollaralso helped to support precious metals. In the week ahead, we will have major central bank meetings to take into account.
Perhaps gold may end up reaching a new record high, but with long-term charts still signally overbought technical conditions, we could see a bit of a reversal. Still, bearish speculators must witness a proper reversal signal before entertaining the idea of shorting gold.
In recent weeks, gold has been able to benefit from various factors, and was able to ignore the prior gains in the dollar and bond yields. It has been supported by inflation hedging, as well as safe-haven demand amid trade war tensions and other geopolitical risks.
Last week, though, Trump refused to introduce tariffs on US trade partners immediately. This triggered a sharp relief rally for financial markets outside the US. But with easing market fears, you would think, there should be less demand for haven assets – as we found out for example with the yen pairs on Friday. Any further easing of tension could potentially pave the way for a retracement and consolidation in gold prices.
Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

Note: Financial Health Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating stronger financial health.
With these tech giants holding significant weight in major indices, their results will undoubtedly influence broader market trends.

Investors should be prepared for increased volatility, particularly in tech sectors tied to AI, cloud computing, and software spending, while also looking for post-earnings opportunities in stocks that demonstrate resilience and growth.
Common themes like cost management, AI monetization, and global performance will provide a roadmap for navigating opportunities and risks in the weeks ahead.

AAPL was headed lower, since the support at 435 was too weak and had no historical signficance. Last week, AAPL broke through this level and appears to be headed lower towards more defined support.AAPL has some support at 419.70 which is the purple line the weekly chart, but this still isn’t the strongest support level. A more clearly defined support is at 404, then further down at 365. Another potential target is 10% lower, which is the measured move (the high of 483.53 and the low of 434.96) of thelatest chart pattern breakdown; this would put AAPL at 390.00.

Gold’s historic negative correlation with the dollar has weakened in recent times, but a sharp drop in thedollar index, owing to Trump’s softer tone towards tariffs, has allowed the likes of theEUR/USDto stage a sharp recovery. But with yields bouncing back a little, it looks like investors are not convinced that Trump will be able to bring down inflation meaningfully.
His protectionist policies are seen boosting prices, which would argue against a rate cut any time soon from the Federal Reserve. At next week’sFOMC meeting, it will therefore be all about how theFedviews the economy, and the focus will be on any hints they may provide for future cuts.
We will also hear from a couple of other central banks in the week ahead, including theEuropean Central Bank. If these central banks are more hawkish than expected, gold may fall back from these overbought levels. But the trend is bullish, and dip-buyers will be lurking should we see a meaningful retracement
With the gold forecast and trend still positive, dip-buyers will be looking to fade into any short-term dips. Key short-term support is now seen around $2750 area. Below this zone, you have the more significant support resting around the $2710-$2725 area.
Previously a strong resistance, could we see an equally strong bounce from this zone on any short-term dips? If we don’t see a bounce there, then that could mark a turning point in the gold trend.
On the upside, a retest of the all-time high at $2790 is now the immediate target for the bulls, with the psychological $2800 barrier also likely to draw in some profit-taking activity. If we see any potential reversal signals around these levels, treat them with some respect as both the monthly and weekly charts remain at overbought technical levels.
The monthly chart of gold shows its first green candle after a two-month consolidation phase where the metal edged lower to close the year in 2024. However, that was not nearly enough to unwind the overbought technical conditions, with the monthly RSI is still above 75.00. This will eventually need to be addressed either through price action or time.
Meanwhile, the RSI on the weekly chart of gold (chart not included) shows a potential negative divergence with price – that is, the RSI is making a lower low while gold is potentially on the verge of making a higher high above October’s peak. Such negative divergences typically point to waning momentum.
But these RSI signals on their own are just warning signs and not necessarily a reason to sell. Bearish traders on gold must also observe a reversal in the trend before entertaining the idea of shorting the metal.

These mega-cap titans will not only showcase their financial performance but also offer critical insights into economic and technological trends.
As investors prepare for these market-moving events, several interconnected themes emerge across these tech leaders.
Artificial intelligence remains at the forefront, with each company expected to detail their AI monetization strategies and infrastructure investments. Enterprise adoption rates of Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta's AI infrastructure spending will be particularly scrutinized, as will Google’s progress in the rollout of its Gemini AI platform.
Cloud computing growth continues to be a critical focus, especially for Microsoft’s Azure, Amazon's AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, as enterprises globally accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
Meanwhile, the digital advertising landscape, crucial for Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, will provide insights into broader economic conditions and marketing spending trends.
Margin management has become increasingly important as these companies balance growth investments with profitability. This is particularly relevant for Tesla amid pricing pressures and Apple's hardware margins in a competitive market.
The international market performance will also be closely watched, especially in China, where Apple faces increasing competition and Tesla navigates market share challenges.
Looking ahead, the broader economic environment, including interest rates and consumer spending patterns, will likely feature prominently in forward guidance across all companies.

AAPL was headed lower, since the support at 435 was too weak and had no historical signficance. Last week, AAPL broke through this level and appears to be headed lower towards more defined support.AAPL has some support at 419.70 which is the purple line the weekly chart, but this still isn’t the strongest support level. A more clearly defined support is at 404, then further down at 365. Another potential target is 10% lower, which is the measured move (the high of 483.53 and the low of 434.96) of thelatest chart pattern breakdown; this would put AAPL at 390.00. Ultimately things look bearish for AAPL: we have a death cross, a well established downtrend and continued selling enough to break support.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Enhances App Store Tools as iOS 18 Adoption Surges,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-enhances-app-store-tools-141137701.html,09:11AM,Finviz.com,"Apple (AAPL,Financials)announcedmajor updates to its App Store platform, aimed at providing developers with enhanced tools for app management and improving the overall user experience.
These changes coincide with the period of time when Apple's most recent operating systems are being adopted at hitherto unprecedented rates.
Reflecting great customer acceptance of the newest software, 76 percent of new iPhones produced in the previous four years run iOS 18 as of January 21, 2025. iOS 18 is loaded on 68 percent of iPhones on active devices; 19 percent remain on iOS 17 and 5 percent utilize prior versions. Likewise, 63 percent of freshly launched iPads run on iPadOS 18; 53 percent of all active iPads run on the most recent version.
Apple's tool for app administration, App Store Connect, lets developers upload, publish, and oversee their apps more quickly. Improved sales and download tracking, complete financial management capabilities, and simplified procedures for app testing and in-app purchase administration constitute new features.
Apple has redesigned its App Review process to enhance developer success and provide a safer and more reliable surroundings for consumers. The new method provides better rules to assist developers in preparing their entries and solves typical causes of app rejections. The update also has a simpler appeals procedure for developers trying to get deleted applications back on line.
Apart from administration tools, Apple has included fresh business and marketing insights to support developers in raising app discoverability and user interaction. These tools include techniques for creating successful product pages, using pre-orders, and best using in-app purchasing capabilities. Deeper understanding of user behavior made possible by improved analytics helps developers to customize onboarding experiences and react more successfully to user evaluations.
These improvements, according to industry observers, would not only simplify the app creation process but also help Apple's position in the cutthroat app business to be strengthened. Apple wants to draw more developers to its platform by offering strong support and cutting-edge tools thus promoting creativity and increasing the spectrum of accessible apps for consumers.
Apple's constant investment in the App Store ecosystem emphasizes its will to maintain a safe and vibrant market, thereby assuring that both customers and developers benefit from a flawless and quick app experience.

US0378331005,AAPL,DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-sell-off-reminds-investors-of-the-biggest-earnings-story-holding-up-the-stock-market-141101978.html,09:11AM,Finviz.com,"Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not onlywhat's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.
New developmentsfrom Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.
Nvidia stock dropped more than than 11%. Meanwhile fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more in early trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.
""When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis,"" Ritholtz Wealth Management chief investment strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. ""That’s exactly what we’re seeing today.""
A slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With withindex valuations near multi-decade highsand the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.
But unlike other risks likehigher interest ratesorsticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.
In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead,causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the ""Magnificent Seven"" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.
As Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-strengthening-ai-132339230.html,08:23AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.
The moment of reckoning has arrived: China’s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US’s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump’s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.
When he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden’s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to “make America the world capital in artificial intelligence”.

The President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The “Stargate initiative” will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow “people with a lot of money” to invest in so-called “AI plants” that power data centers for artificial intelligence.
Trump’s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world’s first reasoning model, o1, which used a “chain of thought” to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called “Gemini Flash Thinking” in December and a few days later, o3 was born.
Keeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.
Third-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek’s model outperformed Meta’s Llama 3.1, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn’t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI’s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.
“To see the DeepSeek new model, it’s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously”.
DeepSeek’s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia’s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump’s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points(see more details here).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm’s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a “strong report” from Apple due to the iPhone 16’s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple’s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.
“Partly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features, which we see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),” Mohan wrote.
Overall, AAPLranks 2ndon our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

US0378331005,AAPL,"Morning Bid: AI, aye, aye",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-ai-aye-aye-110322809.html,06:03AM,Finviz.com,"(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Amanda Cooper, Finance and Markets Breaking News Editor, Europe.
Stocks are getting hammered on Monday, with hefty declines in the technology sector as artificial intelligence big guns like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel took a dive.
The trigger was a burst of hype around the launch last week of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI rival to ChatGPT. Not only is DeepSeek's app now top of the leaderboard on the Apple Store in terms of downloads, online searches for ""DeepSeek"" have exploded in the last 7 days, while those for its larger competitor have remained stagnant.
With four out of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" due to report earnings this week, the rise of DeepSeek as a possible alternative to Western-led AI has served as a dose of reality.
Investors have been willing to shell out for these stocks' sky-high valuations on their promises to deliver juicy returns with their investments in AI.
The Magnificent Seven, a group comprising Wall Street's biggest companies by market capitalisation that includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Facebook parent Meta, now account for a third of global market value, compared with around a fifth two years ago, according to asset manager Federated Hermes.
DeepSeek rolled out an open-source reasoning model called DeepSeek-R1 on Monday that it said rivalled OpenAI's o1 on several performance benchmarks. Tests last month on its V3 large language model outperformed those of OpenAI and Meta, with a smaller development budget and plans to charge users a lot less.
OpenAI kicked off the race in AI development after it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. But it was Nvidia, whose supercomputing chips power a lot of AI applications, that really ignited the rally in the stock market when it delivered bumper earnings in May 2023 that sent its valuation soaring above $1 trillion.
Since then, Nvidia shares have risen by 250%. Investors have been happy to let its Mag-7 companions ride higher on its coattails, but only to a point. Apple shares are up just 26% in that time, while Microsoft is up 34%. Meta has been a bigger winner since then, up 145%.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week unveiled a plan for private-sector investment of $500 billion in AI infrastructure aimed at outpacing rival nations. Oracle, one of the companies involved in the joint venture, along with Japan's SoftBank and OpenAI, saw its shares jump 7% and the second-biggest daily traded volume in its stock in a year.
Slower roll-outs of AI applications, higher costs and other hiccups have tested investors' faith in Wall Street's dominant players in the sector, but have not curbed their enthusiasm.
Now, competitors are starting to snap at their heels.
China's ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, last week released an update to its flagship AI model - a direct challenger to OpenAI - while in the world of smartphones, Samsung last week unveiled its newest Galaxy S25 smartphones, powered by Qualcomm's chips and Google's AI model, which it hopes can help pump up sales and fend off both Apple and Chinese rivals.
Apple, Microsoft and Meta will report quarterly results this week, along with electric car maker Tesla.
Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:
* Super Micro Computer Q2 earnings
* 2- and 5-year U.S. Treasury auctions

US0378331005,AAPL,Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Apple Inc,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unlocking-intrinsic-value-analysis-apple-110140383.html,06:01AM,Finviz.com,"In this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator usesEPS without NRIas the default for the DCF model based onresearchthat shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
As of 2025-01-27, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by theDiscounted Earnings modelis $160.20. It's currently trading at a price of $222.78. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -39.06%. The company is modestly overvalued.
The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated byDiscounted Earningsmodel are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.
Term
Value
Explanation
EPS without NRI
$6.75
GuruFocus DCF calculator usesEPS without NRIas the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.
Discount Rate
11%
An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.53%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.
Growth Stage
Growth rate (g1) = 15.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10
We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.
Terminal Stage
Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10
For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.

GuruFocus also provides the calculation using thetraditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm)Free Cash Flow per Shareas a parameter, theDCF intrinsic valuebased on free cash flow is $144.50. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -54.17%. You can always switch to usingFree Cash Flow per Shareto calculate the real DCF model on ourDCF calculator page.
Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:

US0378331005,AAPL,Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6cd2de32-19d3-3723-96d4-731560c712e9/should-you-buy-berkshire.html,05:41AM,Finviz.com,"To say thatBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than theS&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.
There could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?
You might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.
However, another companywillreport its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 --Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of newgenerative AIfeatures available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.
Why does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.
Berkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?
Over the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.
Could Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.
For example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1stock splitthat excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.
On Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.
So should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?
There's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.
That appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.
Analysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.
Despite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.
I don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.

US0378331005,AAPL,"1 Market-Beating ETF That Doesn't Have Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple Among Its Top 3 Holdings",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b069a719-514e-3e99-a845-f5a59a7d7a91/1-market-beating-etf-that.html,05:04AM,Finviz.com,"Many top exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have been outperforming theS&P 500in recent years all have a common theme, which is that their top three holdings usually include at least one of the following tech stocks:Nvidia,Microsoft, orApple.
There's nothing wrong with those stocks, as they give investors exposure to some fantastic companies, but their high valuations could make investors hesitant about investing in funds that are so dependent on them. If there's a correction in the market, particularly in tech, those three stocks may be particularly vulnerable.
For investors who want to focus ongrowth stocksbut don't want heavy exposure to those three tech giants, one ETF you may want to consider isAmerican Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: QGRO). Here's a closer look at the fund, and why it could make for a fantastic long-term investment.
The American Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF holds 200 stocks in its portfolio, with a weighted average market cap of around $407 billion. The fund's top three holdings areNetflix,Booking Holdings, andTJX Companies. And none of those three stocks individually account for even 4% of the ETF's total weight. Its top 10 stocks, in total, represent a fairly modest 29% of American Century's total portfolio. That's great diversification for investors as it reduces the risk that one or even a few poor-performing stocks could sink the fund.
Tech stocks still play an important role in its performance, however, making up 37% of the ETF's holdings. But without heavy exposure to any individual stock, that can make American Century a much more attractive option for growth investors. You're still getting exposure to many great tech stocks, but that diversification can help reduce your overall risk. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple are all within the fund's portfolio but together, they represent just 3.8% of its total weight.
Other sectors that are key components of the ETF include consumer discretionary, which accounts for 16% of its holdings, followed by industrials at 11%, and communication services at 10% -- the last one to be in the double digits.
The American Century ETF has only been around since 2018 and so it doesn't have a long track record. But over the past five years, it has easily outperformed the S&P 500, without having to rely heavily on a select few tech stocks. That's an impressive performance and speaks to the quality of the growth stocks it contains in its portfolio.
The fund has anexpense ratioof 0.29%, which is a bit higher than other ETFs, but it's still fairly low overall. And I believe it's justifiable given the more balanced growth option it provides investors.
As well as the fund has performed of late, American Century can potentially remain a market-beating ETF in the years ahead due to its diversification. Its safer mix of growth stocks can position investors to benefit from the market's long-term gains without having to worry about a few stocks that could derail its performance.
For investors who want a fund that isn't as dependent on the three most valuable stocks in the world, this ETF can be a great option to add to your portfolio right now and hang on to for the long haul.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $42,191!*
Netflix:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004,you’d have $527,206!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

US0378331005,AAPL,Wall Street Options Pros Play It Cool Before Key Earnings Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-options-pros-play-100000305.html,05:00AM,Finviz.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Options traders are keeping calm ahead of this quarter’s biggest week of earnings.

Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30
Companies representing more than 30% of the Russell 1000 Index’s market value are expected to report this week, including technology and energy giants from Apple Inc. to Exxon Mobil Corp. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest rate decision Wednesday, while Donald Trump is issuing executive orders and pronouncements on everything from interest rates to oil prices.
Despite all that, traders are showing little appetite to hedge against sudden swings in share prices. That’s partly because stocks hit record highs last week amid optimism that inflation will keep slowing and signals that Trump may temper some of his campaign-trail talk around higher tariffs. The Cboe Volatility Index sank to this year’s low, signaling a big shift in sentiment from late 2024, when traders were increasingly concerned about the path of interest-rate cuts by the Fed and potential Trump administration policies.
“The market is relatively risk-tolerant and looks like everybody is on a good mood,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Most of the positioning so far is not showing a tremendous bias one way or the other.”
One broad measure illustrates the market calm. The put-call ratio across US stocks is near multi-year lows, indicating a decline in demand for downside protection.
“That’s a decent indicator of what clients are thinking as far as owning more upside into the big-cap tech earnings, especially after Netflix results,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler. “Outside Apple, the sentiment is pretty optimistic.”
Take Meta Platforms Inc. Options are implying a 6.7% move in the session after it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would lag the average 11% fluctuation following the past eight results. The put skew also shows that traders are far less risk averse now than before the last release, when it was much steeper.
Microsoft Corp. has a similar pattern: Its skew has flattened, signaling that traders are not betting on big stock moves in either direction. Tesla Inc., whose 7.7% expected swing pales next to its 12% average fluctuation following past results, has a call skew as traders shifted their wagers after Trump’s election to favor further gains in the stock.
Apple options are implying a bigger move than what was realized in the past. Yet its skew, which has been steeper than most of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech giants since the middle of 2024, has narrowed in recent weeks. While traders have become more cautious after the stock received a pair of analyst downgrades, the lack of upside positioning in the shares creates more room for a positive surprise.
Of the biggest companies reporting earnings this week that have active options trading, most are implying smaller fluctuations than realized on average in the session following the past eight quarterly reports. Options on Apple and semiconductor company Lam Research Corp. appear to be the most overpriced, while those on Meta and Tesla are underpriced.
Outside of tech, Exxon and Chevron Corp. lead oil major earnings late in the week. Options are pricing little difference between the expected stock swing and past moves. While oil futures slipped last week, with Trump urging OPEC to lower the price of crude, there appeared to be little shift in positioning among the producers.
Overall, the options market expects earnings volatility this quarter to be below the three-year average fluctuations in the day following past results and well below last quarter’s realized moves, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s global quantitative and derivatives strategy team.
“The average implied moves are the lowest going into earnings since the 4Q23 earnings season,” strategists including JPMorgan Daniel Motoc wrote in a note.

US0378331005,AAPL,Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d0b12974-adb8-346c-86f0-bfc7e28c1c02/meet-the-stock-warren-buffett.html,04:51AM,Finviz.com,"WhenBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.
Buffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, helays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Streetand keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.
But when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.
Logic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.
Tech giantApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).
However, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.
Credit-services providerAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP)has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. ""AmEx,"" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an ""indefinite"" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.
Yet it's been alongtime since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.
Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding,Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.
But since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.
Interestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filedForm 13Fswith the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.
Rather, detailed purchasing activity of this ""favorite stock"" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in isshares of his own company.
However, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.
On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.
Even though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.
Aside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.
For one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.
The other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.
With Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.

Used phones preloaded with TikTok are being resold on websites like Facebook and eBay for thousands of dollars.
While TikTok is active again are briefly shutting down last weekend, the platform remains unavailable on the App Store andGooglePlay. So anyone who deleted the app can’t redownload it.
Across Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and other online storefronts, unlocked phones with TikTok preinstalled are apparently a hot ticket. While actual transactions are unconfirmed, phones are going for thousands of dollars—and even tens of thousands of dollars.
Eden Miller listed their iPhone 15 with TikTok on Facebook Market,asking for $9,000. By contrast, Apple's price for a new iPhone 16 starts at $799.
“I heard there's a high value market on them,” Miller toldFortune. “Hopefully it's worth my asking price.”
While $9,000 seems a bit steep for a phone that has someone else's data all over it, that’s not even the upper echelon of asking prices.
New York native Nicholas Matthews listed his iPhone 14 Plus with TikTok for $10,000, according to theAssociated Press,though his highest bid reached more than $4,500.
The AP also reported that some prices wereas high as $50,000oneBay.
Others are taking to online storefronts to promote their$50 TikTok installation serviceas a way to get around the App Store barrier.
“At this time we’re able to still download and install it with a quick trick which allows you to download it from Apple’s servers,” Facebook Marketplace lister Toby Davis toldFortune.
Last weekend, TikTok went dark as an impending ban from the U.S. government loomed. Additionally,Appleand Google took all of the apps created by its Chinese parent company ByteDance off of its servers.
In addition to TikTok, the other apps include TikTok Studio, TikTok Shop Seller Center, CapCut, Lemon8, Gauth, and MARVELSNAP.
In areleaseon Jan. 19, Apple said that users that had the apps previously installed will remain on their devices, but they will not update and cannot be redownloaded or restored if deleted.
“Apple is obligated to follow the laws in jurisdictions where it operates,” the company said.
While President Donald Trump has put the TikTok ban on hold temporarily, it will go dark again if ByteDance doesn’t sell it to a U.S. buyer soon.
Trump has indicated that a deal will get done to bring TikTok into American hands within the next 30 days, with rumors circulating aboutOracle. When asked if a deal was in place with Oracle, Trump dismissed the speculation.
“No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing,” Trump toldreporters this weekend.

We recently published an article titledJim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump’s $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it’s different from the previous one. Cramer shared, “If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.” According to him, “These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation” to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.
Commenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, “Now, by the way, there’s a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?” This means wondering where he is “in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.” Cramer believes that Musk “doesn’t seem to have them” and added, “If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don’t want a seat at the table, I want a table.”
The CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to “forget healthcare.” He believes “Healthcare’s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it’s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there’s a call center that’s better.”
Cramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, “Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there’s a lot more room.” Cramer believes “there’s a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that’s coming on.” He doesn’t like small-cap stocks either. “And I’m not a small cap aficionado,” Cramer commented. He believes, “That stuff doesn’t work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.” The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes “companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn’t think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven’t done anything lately.”
As for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:
“The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That’s where the President’s going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.”
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer’s morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg’s comments in Joe Rogan’s podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:
“I said last night it’s going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it’s going lower, I think they’ll miss the quarter. I think there’s another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it’s a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That’s all I’m saying. That’s all I’m saying.”

US0378331005,AAPL,Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/not-all-companies-are-backing-away-from-dei-in-the-new-trump-era-140137635.html,09:01AM,Finviz.com,"Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era — successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.
The giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from itsdiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)practices.
The measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.
""Our position on these issues is not new,"" Costco’s board chairman Tony James said about the company’s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.
""We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,” James added.
An NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.
""While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,"" saidStefan Padfield, NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project executive director.
Many prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to ""combat illegal private sector DEI actions.""
“My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,” Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Over the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe’s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.
Many of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.
But Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.
""Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,"" the company said in its proxy statement.
Some big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according toa report in the Wall Street Journal.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.
""Bring them on,"" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI duringan interview with CNBClast week in Davos.
""We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.""

U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 still scored their second straight positive week after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The Dow and S&P 500 advanced 2.1% and 1.7%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.6%.
Source: Investing.com
The blockbuster week ahead is expected to be an eventful one filled with several market-moving events, including a key Fed FOMC meeting, an important inflation reading, as well as a flurry of heavyweight tech earnings.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could hit back at rate cut pressure from President Trump when he speaks in the post-meeting press conference.
Markets currently don't expect a rate cut until June, though the May meeting is a close call, as per the Investing.com Fed Monitor Tool.
Besides the Fed, most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.

Meanwhile, the earnings season hits full swing, with four of the massive ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech stocks set to report their latest results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.
These mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe isjustfor the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.
Meta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.
Market participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.
Source: InvestingPro
Profit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta’s earnings potential.
Analysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company’s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
The company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.
Looking ahead, I believe Meta’s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.
Meta’s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.
Source: Investing.com
META stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.
Shares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.
As InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.

In stark contrast, Apple, the world’s largest consumer electronics company, finds itself in a more precarious position due to weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 and broader challenges in the consumer electronics market.
Apple’s fiscal first quarter earnings print is scheduled to come out after the market close on Thursday at 4:30PM ET in what will likely be one of the most closely watched reports of the week. A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.
The expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company’s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.
Source: InvestingPro
Underscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.
While the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand—particularly in China—are raising concerns about Apple’s growth trajectory.
Analysts are also worried about Apple’s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.
Adding to the uncertainty, Apple’s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.
Source: Investing.com
AAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.
At its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
It is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.
Furthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth. Additionally, the stock trades at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples.

US0378331005,AAPL,Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/786d2121-6aac-3eec-9e8d-7240b64d3fa2/warren-buffett-has-%2469.9.html,08:44AM,Finviz.com,"There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control ofBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.
There aren't anysecrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.
We can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 millionApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.
Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.
Buffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top ofBerkshire's portfolioif he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.
Berkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.
Trailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.
A mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.
Investors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.
Apple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.
Fiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue. While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.
The bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.
Apple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.

Donald Trump was sworn in as President for a second term, promising economic and market growth, deportations and tariffs.
Once markets reopened after the Martin Luther King holiday, the result was a solid one for stocks. The S&P 500 added 1.7% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.65%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.2%.

January is turning into a strong month. The Dow, up 4.4% going into the last week of trading, is off to its best start since 2019. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with gains of 3.7% and 3.3% in January, respectively, are enjoying their best starts since 2023.
Part of the gains are due to the Trump rally. Measured from the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 is up 5.5%. The Nasdaq has jumped 8.2%, and the Dow has risen 5.2%. The Nasdaq-100 Index, which includes all of the big technology stocks and a lot of growthy stocks, is up 7.7%.

The week ahead brings us one of the most important weeks of any earnings season. A total of 349 companies are due to report quarterly reports.
What sets the week apart is who's reporting.
It includes a bevy of giant tech stocks, including four of the seven Magnificent 7 companies — Apple(AAPL), Meta Platforms(META), Microsoft(MSFT)and Tesla(TSLA).
They are joined by such giants as AT&T(T), Boeing(BA), Starbucks SBUX, money manager Blackstone(BX), personal finance giant(SOFI), Caterpillar(CAT)and Sherwin Williams(SHW).

Toward the end of the week, the energy sector of the S&P 500 starts to weigh in, starting with Shell(RYDBF)and Baker Hughes(BKR)on Thursday and, on Friday, the giants: Exxon Mobil(XOM)and Chevron(CVX).
Around the first four companies are a host of questions, all different, that investors might consider:
Apple's economic power is built on the overwhelming success of the iPhone since its introduction in 2007. So, slowing sales may be a surprise to some. The shares, however, are down 11% since Dec. 31 after jumping 30.1% in 2024. The iPhone 16 is a concern because it has not been the huge success Apple and its investors expected.
Related: Analysts set surprising price targets for Apple before earnings
Other issues are slow sales in China and problems getting enough artificial intelligence features into the iPhone. Much of that may be fixed when the iPhone 17 comes out. It's due in September. One other challenge for all cell-phone companies: Mobile telephony is getting to be a mature market.
The rap on Apple right now is that it isn't innovating enough. There is no gotta-have product coming right now.
But its elements, starting with a $3.35-trillion market cap, the strength of the iPhone franchise and its Apple store, give the company so much power and time to fix problems, that no analyst dares to rate it a sell.
The consensus on Apple earnings is $2.34 a share, up from $2.18 a share. The revenue estimate is $124 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago.
The stock of the Facebook parent is up 10.6% this year after a 65% gain in 2024. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has become friendly with the Trump Administration, but the company never seems to make critics happy.
Related: Analyst revisits Meta stock price target as Zuckerberg drops bombshell
On the other hand, the company has a market cap of $1.64 trillion. The ad business is very strong, and Meta employs artificial intelligence to deliver ads of interest to increasingly specific groups of users.
There are some risks: Reliance on advertising is a big one. Another is big: How much further can it grow its audience.
Meta's fourth-quarter earnings estimates are $7.29 a share on revenue of $47 billion. If this were the case, earnings would be up 26.6%, and revenue would jump 17.1%.
Microsoft shares have been a bit of a laggard, partly because of its huge bet on artificial intelligence. They were up nearly 57% in 2023 as the AI frenzy took off. But they were up 12.1% in 2024. So far, in January, the stock has been up 5.35%.
Related: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025
Investors have been a bit nervous seeing the company spend $80 billion a quarter to build out AI.  But 52 of 57 analysts who cover the stock rate it a buy or strong buy. Only five say it's a hold. The market cap is $3.3 trillion.
But the company believes all will be visible when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Earnings for the fiscal second quarter are estimated at $3.11 a share, up from $2.93 a year ago. Revenue is expected to jump 11% to $68.8 billion.
Look for continued profits from its Microsoft Office products. A major portion of revenue comes from customers simply renewing their licenses.

Tesla shares are down 4.7% in January after a 62% gain in 2024. The annual return came after the shares fell more than 56% in the first quarter of 2024 because of worries Tesla's sales were falling.
The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is 77 cents a share, up 8.4% from a year ago. Revenue of $27.1 billion would be up 7.8%.
A challenge for the company is its inability to come up with a moderately priced vehicle for the U.S. market. While Tesla has intense fans, they are mostly moderate to affluent buyers.
Related: Elon Musk, Sam Altman brawl over major AI deal
At the same time, CEO Elon Musk hates his company being called a car company. He believes Tesla is really an artificial intelligence company. One reason: every Tesla vehicle communicates where and how it is is being driven, Tesla collects all that data to improve vehicles and driving experience and improve the software that drives them.
There is hope the company will introduce a sport utility vehicle this year. And Musk is promising to bring a Robo Taxi to market perhaps this year.
The solar battery business is, apparently, solid.
One question that may get asked in the earnings call is how Musk can do two full-time jobs at once: running Tesla and working with the Trump Administration to cut federal spending.
Note:The three remaining Mag 7 stocks are Google-parent Alphabet(GOOGL)and Amazon.com(AMZN), due Feb. 6, and Nvidia(NVDA), due Feb. 26.

The week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.
Earnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 — highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) — are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.
Last week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.
Markets welcomed Trump's initial days in office aslimited news on tariffssteadied investors and a massiveAI investment announcementhelpedboost tech stocks.
Four trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new presidentis in the driver's seat of the stock market.
On Tuesday,marketsrallied as the dollarfellafter Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.
Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.
""The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,"" Chronert said. ""Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.""
On Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announceda new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed ""Stargate""to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.
Oracle and SoftBank — along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) — rallied on the news.
In week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.
With a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.
Data from theCME Group showsmarkets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.
This past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd ""demand that interest rates drop immediately."" These commentsstirred discussionabout a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.
Even so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. ""Powell’s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,"" Feroli wrote.
""For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday""
Several key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.
On Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.
Friday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in December,unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.
RBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week — combined with Trump's policies — could leave the Fed ""playing third fiddle"" in markets.
Gwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could ""quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week’s press conference.""
S&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.
But much of that growth still relies on the performance of the""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks. And four of those companies — Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple — will report in the week ahead.
This group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.
As the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists tocall for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.
Though as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out inhis 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is ""likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].""
Notably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.

Monday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day
Apple
What happened?On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.
*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.
What’s the full story?Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.
Jefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.
The AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.
Ford
What happened?On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.
*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.
What’s the full story?Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.
While cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.
Veeva Systems
What happened?On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.
*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.
What’s the full story?Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva’s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.
Additionally, Veeva’s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.
Goldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.
Twilio
What happened?On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.
*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.
What’s the full story?Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.
Acknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f886197e-3b75-35f8-94fc-c4733019daaa/apple-receives-rare.html,Jan-25-25 06:32PM,Finviz.com,"In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.
For its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple'sartificial intelligence (AI)features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.
Jefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.
Given the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.
Despite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.
Where Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.
Its servicesgross marginis close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.
Right now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.
The company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.
Apple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.
Outside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related theAlphabetantitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.
Apple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.
Some of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.
That said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.

Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) has had aturbulent beginning to 2025,with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.
What Happened:Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth’s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest performer in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.

Apple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock’s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.
“When you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact,”Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC,toldBloomberg.
Why It Matters:Apple’s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline,Nvidia has now overtaken Applein market value.
Despite Apple’s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. ""It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices.

US0378331005,AAPL,Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-best-bear-160205016.html,11:02AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list of11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.
As of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market’s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.
Jeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.

Several economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve’s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed’s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.
Similarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it’s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company’s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company’s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.
Overall, AAPLranks 3rdon our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

The operator has raised concerns that the rise ofvirtual “eSims” that replace Sim cardscould see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.
In a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: “We also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.”
Physical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and itsrivals risk losing groundto the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.
The threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.
BT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.
However, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.
Kester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: “One of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there’s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that’s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they’re feeling.
“It feels like it’s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that’s one of the reasons why they’ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.”
In the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks – similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile – though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.
eSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.
Apple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.
BT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.
In a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: “Increased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.”
Vodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.
Apple did not comment on the BT submission.
In response to last week’s CMA investigation it said: “Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.
“In the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.
“We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”

US0378331005,AAPL,Streaming turned profits in 2024. Wall Street's biggest worry is whether momentum can last.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-turned-profits-in-2024-wall-streets-biggest-worry-is-whether-momentum-can-last-150537831.html,10:05AM,Finviz.com,"For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.
In 2024, that finally changed.
The five giants — Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) — collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.
Netflix led the charge, pulling in roughly$6.9 billion in earningsin the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the companythe unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reportedan additional $1.87 billion in profitsto end the fourth quarter — and nearly 20 million more subscribers.
The other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.
Last year delivered some early answers.DisneyandParamount Globaleach reportedtheir first quarter of streaming profits in August.Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.
Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as ""progress,"" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.
For Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is ""the pace of revenue growth."" He added, ""To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.""
For traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. ""Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.""
The ""streaming wars,"" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led toan era of overspendingas platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.
But investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged,andturn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.
That low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns.
In response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers throughcontroversial password-sharing crackdownsand multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.
Companies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.
""Everything was kind of messy for a few years,"" Macquarie's Nollen said. ""Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.""
(edited)
One obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combatingincreased churnin the face ofhigher prices. (Netflix becamethe latest platformto boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)
""The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,"" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, ""there's a limit"" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.
""Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,"" he said.
To combat fickle subscribers, competing platformsare now bundlingtheir services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, ""There's more strength together.""
""I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,"" Dolgin said. ""So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.""
And if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix — and just basic survival in the streaming-first era — might be a bumpy one.

US0378331005,AAPL,Warren Buffett Could Make Over $3 Billion in Dividend Income in 2025 From These 5 Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3108d41c-8eeb-3512-9c6b-7e79125178df/warren-buffett-could-make.html,05:52AM,Finviz.com,"The late Senator Everett Dirksen once reportedly said, ""A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money."" With that quote in mind, Warren Buffett's dividend income this year will be real money.
Technically, the dividend income will belong toBerkshire Hathaway. But for many, Buffett and Berkshire are practically synonymous. And they could make over $3 billion in dividend income in 2025 from these five stocks.
Buffett seems to have soured somewhat onBank of America(NYSE: BAC). He significantly reduced Berkshire's stake in the big bank last year. However, Bank of America (BofA) still contributes a lot of cash to the conglomerate's coffers.
As of Sept. 30, 2024, Berkshire owned 766,305,462 shares of BofA. With the company's forward dividend of $1.04, that translates to nearly $797 million in dividend income this year. Of course, if Buffett sells more of this stock, the amount of dividends received will be lower.
The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO)is one of Buffett's ""forever stocks."" He's held it the longest of any other stock in Berkshire's portfolio. In his 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote, ""The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to$704million."" That total should be even greater this year.
Berkshire has owned 400 million shares of Coca-Cola for a long time. Coke pays a forward dividend of $1.94. If Buffett doesn't sell any shares (which seems to be a safe assumption), Berkshire will rake in at least $776 million in dividend income from the big food and beverage company this year. The amount will likely be higher, though. Coca-Cola is aDividend Kingwith 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. I fully expect the company will keep that streak going in 2025.
Chevron(NYSE: CVX)is a more recent addition to Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett initiated a stake in the giant oil and gas producer in 2020 when its shares were beaten down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Berkshire owned 118,610,534 shares of Chevron at the end of the third quarter of 2024. With the company's dividend of $6.52, the conglomerate should make at least $773.3 million in dividend income this year. Again, though, the actual total will likely be higher. Chevron has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years and could boost its payout soon.
Buffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year thatAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP)would ""almost certainly"" increase its dividends in 2024 by around 16%. He was close. Amex increased its dividend payout by nearly 17%.
The legendary investor also wrote that Berkshire would ""most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year."" I suspect it will do the same in 2025. If so, Berkshire's 151,610,700 shares of American Express with the financial services company's dividend of $2.80 will add up to at least $424.5 million in dividend income this year.
Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)isn't the apple of Buffett's eye that it once was. His position in the consumer tech giant is much lower now than it was a couple of years ago. However, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. It's also still an important source of dividend income.
The math with Apple is easy. Berkshire owned 300 million shares as of Sept. 30, 2024. With a dividend of $1 per share, that translates to $300 million in dividend income for Buffett and his company in 2025. This amount will change if Apple increases its dividend (which is likely) or Buffett sells more of the stock (which could happen).
The expected dividend income for Buffett and Berkshire from these five stocks in 2025 totals $3.07 billion. Which is the best pick for income investors?
I think income investors who aren't billionaires will find several of Buffett's major income producers attractive picks. Coca-Cola offers an especially impressive dividend track record along with a solid forward dividend yield of 3.14%.
However, my vote goes to Chevron as the best stock of the five for income investors. The oil and gas company has the highest dividend yield of the group (4.17%). It has also reliably increased its dividend.
Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:

(AAPL): Slower Revenue Growth vs. Ecosystem Durability  What Wins?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-slower-revenue-085209585.html,03:52AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list ofTop 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.
President Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence.
A prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition.

Dubbed the “Operator”, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields.
“This capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications”.
OpenAI says Operator is “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you”. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations.
The company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows.
“Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it”.
Based on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention.
“AI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we’re going to see it take off”.
According to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as “Buy” and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company’s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.
“We anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence’s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26”.
Overall, AAPLranks 2ndon our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US0378331005,AAPL,Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/fba0a8a6-3c25-3673-9901-7d41e65da65a/billionaire-steven-cohen.html,03:25AM,Finviz.com,"Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.
In the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake inApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position inAxon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.
Importantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.
Apple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.
Apple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.
Furthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibitsAlphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.
Additionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction ofAIfeatures (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, ""Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.""
Finally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33times earningslook expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.
Investors should avoid this stock.
Axon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.
Importantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.
Axon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.
The company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, ""We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications."" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.
Unfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.
If that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
Nvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $381,744!*
Apple:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008,you’d have $42,357!*
Netflix:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004,you’d have $531,127!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

US0378331005,AAPL,Trumps plan to crush Irish economic miracle,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/58631de4-be80-3573-b921-d45d9b8bc7b9/trump%E2%80%99s-plan-to-crush-irish.html,03:01AM,Finviz.com,"Donald Trump was surrounded by a coterie of billionaires at his inauguration, basking in theadoration of the technology elitethat swung behind his campaign to win the White House.
The president benefited from more than $250m (£200m) donated by Elon Musk, the Tesla chief, while Silicon Valley giants ranging from Google to Amazon gave millions to Trump’s inauguration fund.
The returning president is not the only world leader enjoying the largesse of America’s tech companies: Ireland’s government is awash with cash thanks to the taxes paid by US businesses based in the country.
The effects have been transformative. National debt is plunging. Spending is soaring. The country is evenpiling money into a sovereign wealth fund.
Now, Ireland’s economic miracle is under threat. Trump has taken notice of the American riches raining down on the Celtic island – and he wants to repatriate them.
Dublin’s strategy of offering an attractive corporate tax regime – headline rate: 12.5pc, first announced in 1997 – and offering incentives for investment has been stunningly successful.
Tax receipts have swollen, with the corporate levy raking in almost €24bn (£20bn) in 2023 – more than double the €10.4bn raised five years ago and more than five times 2013’s haul of €4.3bn.
Drawn by the favourable tax regime, Ireland has become the beachhead into Europe for Silicon Valley’s biggest names. Apple, Google, Facebook owner Meta and Microsoft have Irish operations that record vast revenues. Apple is thought to be the nation’s biggest taxpayer – its Irish arm records turnover of more than €200bn a year.
Tech taxes have allowed for ballooning government spending, which has risen by an average of 6.5pc a year over the past decade, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.
Ireland’s budget is in a solid surplus despite the spending. Combined with surging economic growth, it means the national debt is tumbling. From more than 100pc of the size of the economy a decade ago, net debt is down to around half.
Taxation as a share of the economy stands at slightly more than 47pc. However, excluding the excess paid by foreign businesses – taxes on activities outside of Ireland paid there by international businesses – the burden on the domestic economy is 37.8pc, the lowest level since 1980. It is a stark contrast to Britain where the tax burden is surging to its highest since the Second World War.
All this has not escaped the notice of Trump and his inner circle. Howard Lutnick, thepresident’s pick as commerce secretary, said in October that American businesses should pay more to the US Treasury instead of filling the coffers of foreign nations.
He singled out Apple’s experience in Ireland as a prime example of the behaviour he wanted to stamp out.
“They make the parts in China, they put the parts together in Taiwan, then they wave their magic wand and it floats over Ireland – of course it floats over Ireland because that is where Apple does its parts – and it comes to America and they make something like 3pc profit in America,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
Traditionally, much of the appeal of an Irish base was the ability to house a company’s intellectual property in Ireland. Tech companies then attribute a significant share of global sales and profits to that IP and so pay the 12.5pc rate rather than a higher tax in the nation where sales are made.
Lutnick fumed: “They pay corporate tax on 3pc profit in America and Ireland announces a massive budget surplus for their 5m people. Ha ha. It is just not true.
“The concept is: have them pay their taxes in America. That is how you fix America. You make it fair, you make it right and you build here.”
As far as Lutnick is concerned, Irish citizens are unfairly enjoying lower taxes and higher spending because ofmoney taken from US companies– money which should go to Washington.
Trump has wasted no time targeting tax since taking office. Trump immediately pulled America out of a global tax deal, which had been backed by his predecessor, Joe Biden, and by the EU, to introduce a worldwide minimum corporate tax rate of 15pc. The agreement obliges Ireland to collect a top-up tax from US companies that declare a tax rate below the 15pc global minimum from next year, setting Dublin on a collision course with Washington.
And Trump went further, ordering an investigation into “whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or corporations to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes”.
Exactly what would count as “discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes” was not spelt out. But what was made clear was athreat to double taxes on foreign individuals and companiesif their home nation is deemed to be unfairly taxing American interests overseas.
Micheál Martin, the new taoiseach, has sought to downplay the threat. “We are not naive about the realities of change but equally the Ireland-America relationship is one which benefits us both and it will emerge strongly no matter what,” he said last week.
The stakes are high. If Trump does force US companies to shift more of their profits back to America, the effects could be devastating for Ireland.
Without intervention, the country is on track to be nearly debt-free by 2040, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. But if the tax boom ends and the government tries to keep on accelerating spending, debt could balloon back to 100pc of GDP in 15 years’ time.
More than one third of Ireland’s corporate tax receipts come from three companies, so it would not take many changes of business strategy or US policy to blow a hole in the national finances.
Last month, Ireland’s central bank warned that “a dependence of the Exchequer on substantial corporation tax receipts, in the main likely linked to the activities of US multinational enterprises, has emerged in recent years”, noting that new tax policies in America could imperil this.
It is not just tax revenues at risk: jobs could go, too.
Apple has had a base in Cork for decades and employs 6,000 people in Ireland. Microsoft has 3,500 staff – not all in the Republic, for it has offices in Belfast as well as Dublin – whileGoogle has 5,000 in Ireland.
It is not only tech companies, either. Low taxes and significant research and development incentives have helped stimulate a major pharmaceuticals industry.
US giant Pfizer has 5,000 staff in Ireland, for instance, including in manufacturing and in research and development. Ireland exported €77bn of pharmaceutical and medical goods in 2023.
The significance of this “real economy” activity might make it sound tough for Trump to drag those revenues to the US.
Yet he has form in trying to reshape other countries’ economies. Witness his efforts to hammer China during his first term, which sent manufacturers running to nations such as Vietnam.
Companies can and do react. Factories, employees and intellectual property have moved west since Trump first became president.
In his first term, the president offered a form of amnesty to companies that had stashed an estimated $2 trillion offshore, allowing them to bring the cash home with tax rates well below the usual level of up to 35pc.
In Dublin, ministers are watching closely for more details of what exactly Trump will do. Whatever the details, they know Ireland’s economic model is under siege.
Martin told the Irish parliament last week: “The task is to protect Ireland’s strength at a moment of real threat, while also addressing critical social needs.
“Ireland is an open democracy with an open economy – we cannot expect to stand unaffected on the sidelines. We must protect and renew an economic model which delivers high employment and resources for public services.”

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Tests Key Technical Level in Worst Start Since 2008,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tests-key-technical-level-152501594.html,04:15PM,Finviz.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s stock has had a rough start to the year and is now flirting with a key level that could signal more downside ahead if breached.

The stock has slumped 11% in 2025 through Friday’s close, making it by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven group. It has also significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which has gained about 3.7% this year and touched a fresh record high earlier this week. Apple’s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.
The level is “always a good reference point of trend,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. “When you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.”
It’s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple’s tumble.
While one single stock doesn’t always move the rest of the index, Apple’s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple’s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that’s now entering its third year.
“The market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,” Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, “it definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we’re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.”
Stockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she’s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.
That level “is a more likely point for the correction to mature,” Stockton said. “We obviously don’t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we’ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.”
Apple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.
Of course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.
“You could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,” said Sohn. “So then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?”

US0378331005,AAPL,Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-among-stocks-chatgpt-211040364.html,04:10PM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list of15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.
2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth—something that had not happened in nearly three decades.

The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.
In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.
While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration’s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers’ costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.
A growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.
While most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.
Whether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.
We prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.
For perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.
On October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.
The company’s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.
The integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in itsQ2 2024 investor letter:
Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.
Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.
Overall, AAPLranks 1ston our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

US0378331005,AAPL,People are ditching their Apple Watches after feeling bullied to burn calories and close their rings,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/16df53fc-81d1-3e55-830f-256459e927ee/people-are-ditching-their.html,12:05PM,Finviz.com,"After much frustration, Ryann Nicole decided to break off her eight-year relationship—with herAppleWatch.
When she first got it, she loved having access to all the data about how manycaloriesshe was burning, herheart rate, and herstep count.
But over time, she realized that her days were revolving around those numbers entirely, and whether or not she had “closed her rings”—a goals-based feature through which users aim to hit certain numbers of calories burned,exerciseminutes, andstand hours.
Nicole says it reached a point where if she hadn’t closed her rings by the end of the day, she’d pace her living room late at night to hit her goals.
“I realized, This is not healthy. This is something that I’m consumed by,” she tellsFortune. “I didn’t work out to enjoy it. It was all about, what did the Apple Watch say?”
Nicole is not alone in tossing the tracker after a relationship that soured. Many—this reporter included—have done so because they felt that what started as a helpful, intriguing tool took a turn to become an annoyance at best and, at worst, a harmful obsession.
It’s pushing a slew of people to share their frustrations on social media.
“I feel ashamed but I’ve been taking a walk at 11:30 p.m. just to complete my ring before midnight,” one former Apple Watch fan posted onReddit.“I was feeling angry if I exercised and forgot to activate the exercise app.”
“I let that thing control me,” another personsaid on TikTok. “If I didn’t hit 10,000 steps a day or close my rings, I would be…pacing at home, trying to close my rings, trying to hit 10,000 steps.”
Apple Watch is not the only fitness tracker that’s bugging people, of course: TheOura RingandWhoophave inspired plenty of their own social media complaints (aboutanxietyandmetrics obsessions, respectively). But the Apple Watch remains themost popular health tracker,and has taken the brunt of fitness-tracker criticism—despite itsmany health benefitsand at least oneremarkable caseof it saving somebody’s life.
Some users on Reddit said they’ve been swapping their Apple Watches for a workout tracker app calledGentler Streak, which emphasizes a “self-compassionate approach to exercise, where recovery is as important as intensity.”
“After five years focusing on closing the rings, I decided that I don’t care anymore,” one userwrote. “I subscribed to Gentler Streak and enjoy a healthier view on working out, in balance with my current body status.”
Research has found that fixation on health tracking has the potential to turn harmful in some cases, especially for perfectionists or people with a history of eating disorders or anxiety. In a 2017 study published inEating Behaviors,researchers found that calorie and fitness tracking devices have been linked to characteristics associated with eating disorders. Additionally, in a2023 study, participants whose Apple watches displayed a deflated step count had reduced self-esteem and increased blood pressure and heart rate; they also ate more unhealthily compared to participants whose step counts were not manipulated.
It's important to note that Apple, which declined to comment for this story, now has more options to adjust your notifications and activity rings: One allows you topause your activity ringsandcustomizeyour daily goals by the day of the week. Another lets you switch your watch face from the activity rings to images of anything you’d like—even the face of a regular watch.
Plenty of Reddit users have taken to the platform todefend the watch, stating how closing their rings motivates them to exercise more, track health metrics, and be more active overall.
In response to the anxiety-fueled posts about closing rings, one personposted on Reddit: “The rings are meant to be a tool or a reference, and not the end-all, be-all. You should control the rings; the rings shouldn't control you.”
Still, over on TikTok, in particular, there are endless complaints. When influencer Sydney Adams Kingpostedthat she was breaking up with her Apple Watch, she said, “I feel like I pay too much attention to it and let it decide if my workouts are good or not.”
Nutritionist and personal trainer Katy Saltsman posted on TikTok that after a vacation spent obsessively checking her Apple Watch to see the status of her goals and activity rings, she realized how much those data points were weighing on her.
“I realized how disconnected I was from my body,” she said in thevideo. “There’s also this stress to hit these random numbers every single day, where even my rest days didn’t feel restful.”
One TikToker titledher video: “Raise your hand if you’ve been personally victimized by Apple Watch notifications.”
“Quite literally nothing has made me crazier or more obsessive than the notifications on this bad boy that are like, ‘You can still do it,’ ‘Close your rings,’ ‘Keep it up,’” she said in the video. “If I needed a stand hour but I was stuck in class, I would discreetly shake my wrist because I needed to close those rings.”
And as one poster on Reddit put it, ditching the Apple Watch—and all fitness trackers—was a “game changer.”
“No more stress from constant monitoring, no more notifications that friends have completed workouts and feeling like a slob for not having completed a workout that day, no more reminder to stand upright after hiking for the last six hours and finally sitting in the car,” the userwrote on Reddit. “I feel free. I started enjoying my workouts without pressure and trying to stay in my zones. It reduced my stress, and I became healthier and happier.”

With this new version, CarPlay will integrate seamlessly with the instrument cluster to provide information on speed, climate control, and other car data. Apple had promised an initial rollout for a limited set of cars for 2024.
Now that the deadline has come and gone,Apple has updated MacRumorson CarPlay's status. While the company doesn’t mention its original roadmap, Apple confirms that it’s still very much a work in progress.
“We continue to work closely with several automakers, enabling them to showcase their unique brand and visual design philosophies in the next generation of CarPlay,” the company told MacRumors. Apple also updated theCarPlay pageon its website to remove the 2024 mention.

(AAPL,Financial) Fiscal First Quarter 2025 results is anticipated to draw market players' attention, with the global market conditions taking a toll on the sector. Apple is expected to post revenue of $124 billion this quarter,a nice 3% year-over-year increase. EPS is expected to rise from $1.47 in the previous quarter to $2.35.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with OONEF.
To a large extent, Apple's stock relies on the emergent performance of its core iPhone lineup, which brings in a large chunk of the company's revenue. Red flags are goingup for analystsregarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.
Investors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.
Apple Shares are downabout 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-enlists-veteran-software-executive-165233765.html,11:52AM,Finviz.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.

Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple’s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She’ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn’t been announced publicly.
The move helps bolster a team that’s racing to make Apple a leader in AI — an area where it’s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.
The Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple’s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.
Vorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She’s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple’s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.
A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.
Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple’s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset’s operating system, according to the people.
Prior to joining Giannandrea’s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group’s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath — as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.
The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.
It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple’s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.
This year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company’s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.
The company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji — a tool for creating custom emoji via AI — have launched more recently.
Apple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn’t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer’s data. It also can identify what’s currently on a user’s screen and more precisely control the device’s applications through a system called App Intents.
The current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won’t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.
Apple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface — something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won’t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.
In another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione — charged with killing a health care executive — had shot himself.
Apple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn’t say when the capability would return.
Last year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea’s group. When the company’s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple’s secretive robotics team within the organization.
When Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple’s executive team — a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.
Vorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn’t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product’s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.

US0378331005,AAPL,Stock prices look expensive and inflated: Billionaire investor Ray Dalio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-prices-look-expensive-and-inflated-billionaire-investor-ray-dalio-160240482.html,11:02AM,Finviz.com,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTubeor wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
A warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.
""I think it depends on what stocks — yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,"" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (video above; listen in below).
Dalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become ""so expensive.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
If the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.
""If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,"" Dalio said, adding, ""Rotation is the important consideration.""
Dalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over thecompany's investment strategies.
The investment veteran, with anestimated net worthof $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet — if at all.
In an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation —or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimpingconsumer purchasing power.
More recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called ""How Countries Go Broke.""
Worst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.

Investors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration,policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in topMag Sevennames like Nvidia.

Stocks are ""priced for perfection,"" warned Goldman Sachs strategistPeter Oppenheimer this month.
Dalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.
""I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,"" said Dalio.

Despite this, the firm sees earnings resiliency as a key strength heading into Apple's January 30 earnings report. BofA expects a strong fiscal Q1, with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's 77 million estimate.
However, Q2 could be weaker, with BofA lowering its iPhone forecast to 49 million units from 56 million, citing macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Beyond hardware, Services remains a bright spot, with 13% growth expected in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year. App Store revenue jumped 15% year-over-year, signaling strong demand.
Analysts also believe China concerns are overblown and expect Trump's administration to ease regulatory pressures from the EU and U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Apple's in-house 5G modem in the iPhone SE could boost margins if successful.

US0378331005,AAPL,Apple Intelligence now turns on automatically. Here's how you can turn it off,https://qz.com/apple-intelligence-iphone-ai-default-turn-off-1851746938,09:14AM,Finviz.com,"This story incorporates reporting fromForbesandtechtimes.
Apple’s recent software update, iOS 18.3, automatically activates the Apple Intelligence feature for both new users and those upgrading on eligible devices. The technology, which received integration with Siri and ChatGPT in previous iterations, is now set to be turned on during the iPhone onboarding process, as per Apple’s beta release notes. This represents a shift from prior updates, where users had to actively opt in to utilize Apple Intelligence’s capabilities. Primarily, the feature is available on newer iPhone models, including the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPhone 16 series.
Despite the automatic activation, users wishing to disable the feature can do so through device settings. To turn off Apple Intelligence, navigate to your iPhone’s Settings, proceed to the Apple Intelligence & Siri panel, and toggle off the feature. The ability to manually control these settings persists, allowing users to choose which elements of Apple Intelligence they wish to keep enabled. This manual control is vital for users concerned about privacy or those who prefer minimal AI intervention in their device’s operations.
The feature, known for enhancing the operating system’s capabilities, was first introduced in iOS 18.1. It was expanded to include enhanced Siri functionalities with the help of ChatGPT through the iOS 18.2 update. The automatic enabling in iOS 18.3 signifies Apple’s commitment to advancing AI features, though it remains essential for users to retain autonomy over their device’s functions.
Apple’s move to automatically enable Apple Intelligence comes amid a broader trend of embedding AI technologies directly into user interfaces. While this enhances device capabilities and user experiences, it also prompts discussions surrounding user consent and the balance between automated enhancements and user control.

US0378331005,AAPL,Analysts set surprising price targets for Apple before earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/664f93d2-797e-3676-a647-84a37a0f0b0a/analysts-set-surprising-price.html,08:07AM,Finviz.com,"People in China consume a lot of apples on Christmas Eve, known in the country as ""Peaceful Night,"" because the Mandarin word for ""apple"" sounds so close to ​​""peace.""
But Apple(AAPL)wasn’t as lucky in the Chinese market during the recent holiday season.
In the December quarter, iPhone sales in China, Apple’s second-largest market, dropped 18.2%. This caused global iPhone sales to decline 5% during this key shopping period, according to research cited by Bloomberg.

The iPhone is Apple’s biggest revenue contributor, accounting for nearly half the sales in the most recent reported quarter.
Apple’s new artificial intelligence feature, Apple Intelligence, is still unavailable in China, which reduces its selling points.
But the soft sales in China aren’t just about lacking AI.
Competition for smartphone sales in China is getting sharper. Data last week indicated that local brands Huawei and Vivo secured first and second place in overall handset-market share in the world's second-largest economy last year.
And price cuts aren’t enough to fix Apple’s troubles in China.
""Apple’s iPhone strategy is fundamentally the same everywhere — set prices above all rivals on the premise that customers are so locked in to their iPhones that they can’t afford to switch to lower-priced rivals,"" Peter Cohan, who runs a management consulting and venture capital firm, told Forbes.
""In countries like China, that strategy only appeals to a small percentage of the market. The majority of its smartphone buyers there are happy to buy from a local manufacturer that offers a much lower-priced product with features tailored to local needs,"" he said.
Apple shares have dropped 13.6% since their Boxing Day peak, wiping out more than $600 billion in market value. The Cupertino, Calif., tech group lost its place as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia(NVDA).
Apple is set to post its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results after the market closes on Jan. 30.
The company expects “low-to-mid-single digit” percent sales growth for the quarter, according to its latest earnings call.
For the most recent quarter ended Sept. 28 Apple reported adjusted fiscal Q4 earnings of $1.64 a share, up 12.3% year-over-year and beating Wall Street's $1.60 consensus estimate. Revenue rose 6% to $94.93 billion, surpassing the $94.58 billion consensus.

IPhone sales reached $46.22 billion in the September quarter, a 6% increase from the year-earlier period and ahead of analysts’ projection. The report also ended a streak of two consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines for the product.
Mac, iPad and other product sales fell short of Wall Street expectations.
Apple’s stock price dropped 1.3% in the trading session following the release of its September quarter results.
Apple stock gained 30% in 2024, but a number of analysts have lowered their price targets for Apple before the next earnings report, citing weak sales and outlook.
Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform from hold and lowered its price target to $200.75 from $211.84, citing ""weak"" iPhone sales, thefly.com reported on Jan. 20.
""We lower forecasts driven by weak iPhone sales and the general [consumer electronics] market and our reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization,"" Jefferies analysts said.
The firm added that Apple could miss its fiscal-first-quarter revenue guidance, and its guidance for the March quarter ""could also disappoint.""
Related: Goldman Sachs analyst tweaks Apple stock price target ahead of Q1 earnings
JP Morgan cut its Apple price target to $260 from $265 while affirming an overweight rating, according to thefly.com.
The investment bank's analyst said that concerns ahead of the earnings report center more on Apple's outlook than on the quarter's results.
JP Morgan predicted Apple could continue losing market share in China, as the company has passed its product cycle peak and local subsidies are focused on low- to mid-tier smartphones, excluding high-end devices.
The firm also said Apple’s AI features are gaining little traction, which could result in flat unit sales in coming quarters. But further declines in unit sales are unlikely ""given trough replacement rates already.""
Loop Capital also downgraded Apple, to hold from buy, with a $230 price target, citing a ""material"" iPhone demand reduction.
""We're downgrading to hold on the heels of work from Loop Capital Supply Chain Analyst John Donovan that suggest a material iPhone demand reduction beginning in the March quarter but materially amplifying in the June and September"" periods, Loop's analyst said.
Loop's previous ""structural buy call could still materialize,"" but it ""certainly won't be for the next nine months,"" the analyst said.
The Wall Street veteran trader Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle said in a post on TheStreet Pro that he was selling his long position in Apple stock.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.
Historically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market’s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow’s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.

Since the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.
Trump’s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.
The U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.
Investing in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.
We shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple’s iPhone which generates 46% of the company’s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple’s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.
CDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024investor letter:
“The crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies – and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn’t mathing.”
Overall, AAPLranks 5thon our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

US0378331005,AAPL,UK CMA investigates Apple and Googles mobile ecosystems,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3d1e7440-ca8b-36d8-aa9b-e6c0ad9291bb/uk-cma-investigates-apple-and.html,04:42AM,Finviz.com,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched investigations into Apple and Google's dominance in mobile ecosystems, focusing on their operating systems, app stores, and browsers.
These ecosystems play a pivotal role in shaping the experiences of users and businesses developing innovative services for mobile devices.
Almost all mobile devices sold in the UK operate on either iOS or Android, with Apple and Google holding exclusive or leading positions in their app stores and browsers.
The CMA aims to determine whether these companies possess strategic market status in these areas.
If they do, the CMA could impose conduct requirements or recommend pro-competition measures to benefit UK consumers and businesses.
The investigation will examine competition levels within and between Apple’s and Google’s ecosystems, the potential misuse of market power, and whether their practices could be exploitative.
CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said: “More competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems. Better competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple’s and Google’s platforms.”
The CMA will also investigate whether Apple and Google prioritise their own services, impose unfair terms on app developers, or restrict user choices.
Possible remedies include facilitating app downloads outside their app stores, supporting alternative payment systems, or granting third-party apps access to essential functionalities.
The CMA will engage with stakeholders, including device manufacturers, software developers, and user groups, and gather evidence from Apple and Google.
A decision is expected by 31 October 2025.
In January 2025, the CMAinitiated an investigationinto Google's search services under the new UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.
In another development, Google is advancing the Android XR platform through a new agreement with HTC. Google has welcomed some HTC VIVE engineering team members to accelerate Android XR platform development.
Google’s spokesperson said: “They are an incredibly strong technical team with a proven track record in the VR space, and we are looking forward to working with them.”

US0378331005,AAPL,"Apple CEO Tim Cook follows a strict routine, including eating at the same cafeteria every dayexperts say its a driving factor behind his success",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-follows-090000062.html,04:00AM,Finviz.com,"Tim Cook, CEO ofApple,shared his morning routine. Experts say that a monotonous schedule can help reduce decision fatigue, but there are downsides.
Whether it be constantly waking up at the break of dawn or takingdaily ice baths, executives aren’t necessarily known for being chill about their daily routine.
On a recent episode ofTable Manners With Jessie and Lennie Ware,Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled his strict daily schedule. He wakes up “probably a little earlier” than 5 a.m. each day.
“It turns out, it’s the part of the day that I can control the most,” he said on the podcast. “As the day starts to unfold, it becomes less predictable, and by the end of the day, all these things can happen to commandeer your time and intention and energy.”
Expressing his love for the part of the day where he can “kind of block out the world and focus on a few critical things and just be silent for a while,” he adds that he typically grabs coffee and eats the same bran cereal each morning while sending and reading emails.
Despite his name, he does not cook. Instead, Cook admits on the podcast that he frequents the company cafeteriaCaffè Macs. He has lunch and takes dinner home from there. “I typically go for the fish,” he says.
”Tim Cook’s 5 a.m. wake-up and consistent meals in the company cafeteria reflect discipline and intentionality,” clinical psychologist Supatra Tovar tellsFortune. “This routine likely minimizes decision fatigue, allowing him to conserve mental energy for high-stakes decisions, which is crucial for success at his level.”
Some self-help experts say that while it might seem monotonous, Cook’s schedule shows the value of having a routine. Others note it’s not all that necessary. Either way, it’s all the rage in the C-suite.
Indeed, Cook is not alone in his proclivity for spending each day the same way. Brian Niccol, former CEO ofChipotleand current CEO ofStarbucks, toldFortunethat he often wakes up around 5:45 in the morning, has a cup of coffee and a cookie, works out around 7 a.m., has a shake or eggs and sausage, and then usually drives his daughter to school before getting into the office around 8:30 or nine in the morning.
“I look to build a lot of consistent routines,” Jack Dorsey, CEO ofBlockand cofounder ofTwitter,echoedback in 2015.
“Same thing every day,” he added, explaining his days start at 5 a.m. and end at 11 p.m. and involve regular meditation, a strict workout schedule, and a five-mile walk to work.
The conceit is that given executives’ workload, time is precious and needs to be parsed out accordingly. “The way CEOs allocate their time and their presence—where they choose to personally participate—is crucial, not only to their own effectiveness but also to the performance of their companies,” Michael E. Porter and Nitin Nohria write inHarvard Business Review,adding that the CEOs they studied worked 9.7 hours per weekday on average.
CEOs stick to said routines “because they provide structure and efficiency, enabling them to focus on priorities without distraction,” Tovar adds. While this rigidity can increase productivity, reduce stress, and help with decision-making, it can also “limit spontaneity and adaptability, which are sometimes necessary for innovation,” she says.
“It reduces your mental load,” Robin Waite, coach and founder of Fearless Business, echoes toFortune. He adds that choosing what to wear and eat are simple choices but can also cost one time.
Of course, some experts think CEOs should be a little more flexible. “Stumbling out of bed too early is just one of the ways entrepreneurs lose touch with their bodies,” psychologist Sherry Walling previously warned inFortune. “They’re looking for life hacks instead of doing some inner reflection,” she said, adding that it’s “unhealthy and unsustainable to design every day around productivity.”
Routine can also be a part of brand identity. “The optics can’t be ignored,” Tovar says. “For some leaders, projecting discipline reinforces their image of reliability and control, though the true value depends on how well the routine supports their actual goals and well-being.”

US0378331005,AAPL,"Oracle, Apple, Google Diverge on Whether to Keep Serving TikTok",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5b9f0567-241f-3c39-9405-8f2c7478cc76/oracle%2C-apple%2C-google%C2%A0diverge.html,12:02AM,Finviz.com,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and Oracle Corp. have reacted differently to President Donald Trump's pledge that the US government won't enforce a national security law that raised potential penalties for US partners of the popular video app TikTok.

How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump
Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30
Oracle, which provides cloud services for TikTok, took Trump’s go-ahead to heart. It’s kept TikTok operational since the app briefly went offline over the weekend. Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, however, which removed the app from their respective app stores to comply with the Jan. 19 ban, have held off on relisting TikTok. The app has been unavailable for the past five days.
This diverging approach by some of the country’s biggest and most powerful tech companies underscores the current confusion around Trump’s order, the uncertainty about TikTok’s future and just how much political capital matters in the Trump era. Tech titans are stuck between complying with the law and appeasing a sitting president who values loyalty and expects others to follow his lead.
“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the statute remains in effect, so there is some legal risk and that’s incontrovertible,” said Glenn Gerstell, who served as general counsel of the National Security Agency during Trump’s first term. “Whether that legal risk is acceptable or not is going to vary with your circumstances.”
Lawmakers and other Washington insiders have raised concern about Oracle’s role in keeping TikTok available to US users. Even with a nod from Trump, critics argue that the company could open itself up to lawsuits from current shareholders and massive fines from a future administration that may want to retroactively enforce those penalties. There is also the possibility that Trump could change his mind on enforcement and go after tech firms for billions in damages.
Oracle’s longstanding coziness with Trump and its lucrative business entanglements with TikTok appear to be enough incentive to take on that potential legal risk. “They've obviously made the business decision that that risk, relative to the reward, is an acceptable one for them,” Gerstell said.
Apple and Google, meanwhile, have come to a different conclusion. While the app is popular, it’s also free to download and the companies likely make minimal revenue from TikTok via in-app purchases compared to any potential fine they may face for violating the law. The potential upside for Apple and Google to ignore the law is “probably far less significant,” Gerstell said.
According to the law, daily fines for supporting TikTok could quickly climb into the billions of dollars if the statute is ultimately enforced. ByteDance, TikTok and Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Project Texas
Oracle leaders have long aligned themselves with conservative politics. Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on Trump’s transition team after the 2016 presidential election, and billionaire co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has donated to Republicans, including Trump. Ellison is also famously close to Elon Musk, a newly central figure to the Trump orbit, and previously sat on Tesla Inc.’s board of directors and has let Musk vacation at his private Hawaiian island.
“He’s sort of CEO of everything — he’s an amazing man, an amazing businessperson,” Trump said of Ellison during an event at the White House earlier this week.
Oracle’s proximity to Trump has paid off in the past. The cloud giant was Trump’s original pick to buy TikTok in 2020 when he also tried to ban the app over national security reasons. Though the deal ultimately fell apart after Trump left office, the outcome for Oracle was arguably more transformative than the partial ownership Trump had proposed: Oracle landed TikTok’s enormous cloud infrastructure business, and was selected as a partner to help the app cordon off sensitive US user data from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., in an effort marketed by TikTok as Project Texas.
TikTok has since become one of Oracle cloud’s most important clients as a crucial early customer of that unit, helping to validate a then-nascent part of Oracle’s business. Last summer, Oracle warned investors that a TikTok ban could hurt revenue and profits and increase expenses. The multiyear cloud contract was already worth over $1 billion by the time TikTok announced in 2022 that US user data was flowing through Oracle’s servers, according to people familiar with the work who asked not to be named discussing private information. Oracle also won work from TikTok to host data in the EMEA region, the people said.
Due to political and press intrigue, work with TikTok was considered highly confidential internally. TikTok was codenamed “Telesis” inside Oracle, and staff working on relevant projects had to sign separate nondisclosure agreements, the people said. Ultimately, a proposal for TikTok to cordon off US user data from its Chinese parent company was never accepted by US regulators, though the two companies still have a cloud partnership.
It couldn’t be determined how much TikTok’s spending on Oracle Cloud has grown since its initial commitments, but Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, estimates Oracle’s annual revenue from TikTok may now be in the range of $500 million to $800 million.
A TikTok Lifeline
Trump’s executive order on his first day in office directed his Justice Department not to enforce penalties from the divest-or-ban law. The order gave ByteDance an additional 75 days to orchestrate a deal for the app while the new administration evaluates the situation.
Under the new law, TikTok can remain in the US if ByteDance executes a “qualified divestiture,” but it’ll largely be up to Trump to determine what kind of deal satisfies the country’s national security concerns. ByteDance would need to finalize a sale by early April, when Trump’s temporary non-enforcement order lifts. But there’s been little indication publicly that ByteDance is willing to sell, nor that it’s entertaining proposals from Trump or offers from interested bidders.
“I think we’re quite optimistic we’ll find a solution,” ByteDance board member and General Atlantic Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford told Bloomberg Television this week.
It’s unclear if Trump’s extension is even legal under the current law. Discussion during TikTok’s Supreme Court hearing made clear that even the justices didn’t know if an extension was allowable after the law went into effect on Jan. 19.
“I am at a loss to describe to you where the law is at this moment,” said Dick Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, earlier this week. The law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress, signed by President Biden and upheld by the US Supreme Court, he added, but “now the new president is saying, ‘ignore it if you wish.’”
Even members of Trump’s own party are criticizing his handling of the matter. Trump loyalist and former VP hopeful, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, believes tech companies helping TikTok operate are opening themselves up to legal penalties and “hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability,” he wrote on X. “Think about it.”
Apple and Google clearly are. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts believe it’s unlikely either company will reinstate TikTok on their app stores because of the potential legal exposure. “When facing risk on this scale, the better course is to heed the law,” wrote analysts Matthew Schettenhelm and Tamlin Bason.
Oracle may see value in following a different path. At an event this week, with Ellison standing feet away, Trump said he was open to the idea of Musk or Ellison buying TikTok. “I’d like Larry to buy it, too,” he said.

Wedbush Securities analysts, led by Dan Ives, shot back at Apple naysayers, saying fears of a major stock hit are “overdone” because of a clear advantage giving the tech company a leg up in the AI arms race.
Despite a losing streak in which Apple’s stock fell just under 6% over the last five trading sessions, Ives and Wedbush reiterated their “outperform” rating and an ambitious price target of $325 per share. As of midday trading Thursday, the stock was trading down less than 1% at $223 per share.
Driving the analysts’ longer term optimism was Apple’s one clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to AI: iPhone market dominance. Although Apple Intelligence launchedjust months agoand is still in development, the analysts foresee about 20% of the world’s population accessing AI through an Apple device “over the coming years.”
“What the bears continue to miss on Apple is its golden installed base of 1.5 billion iPhones and 2.3 billion iOS devices is unmatched and will create a new AI-driven growth story that the Street is not factoring into the stock,” the analysts wrote in a note published Wednesday.
Apple did not immediately respond toFortune’s request for comment.
Apple Intelligence will serve as the foundation for a new “growth renaissance” at the company, driven by developers building hundreds of new apps using the technology. Those new apps will lead to “billions of incremental services growth,” which includes App Store revenue, over the coming years, the analysts wrote.
Wedbush’s positive outlook comes after Apple reportedweaker iPhone salesfor the last quarter of 2024 amidst increased domestic competition in its second-biggest market, China. Still, the analysts led by Ives wrote in the Wednesday note the sales decline is “manageable” and balanced out by sales growth in the U.S. and other regions.
Apple Intelligence is being rolled out cautiously, according to Apple higher-ups,and it still falls short in some areas, including with writing and editing assistance,TheWall Street Journalreported. Last week, Apple alsopausedan AI feature that was incorrectly summarizing headlines from major news outlets such as theBBC.
While Apple Intelligence is still a work in progress, the analysts painted 2025 as a pivotal year for Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple and CEO Tim Cook to further develop its AI strategy and overcome the hiccups.
“We believe there will be bumps in the road as Apple heads down the AI path but ultimately 2025 is a fork in the road year for Cook and Cupertino to prove the doubters wrong,” the analysts wrote.

US0378331005,AAPL,Trump signed an order ending DEI. Heres what it means for Fortune 500 companies,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-signed-order-ending-dei-223731218.html,05:37PM,Finviz.com,"Donald Trump’sfirst few days in officehave been characterized by a flurry of executive orders, and a huge hit for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as we know it.
On Monday, the president signed anexecutive orderputting an end to all federal DEI initiatives, calling them “illegal,” “immoral,” and “discriminatory.” Within 60 days of the announcement, agencies must “coordinate the termination” of all programs.Federal employees and their leaders who work on DEI initiatives were also placed on paid administrative leave as ofWednesday at 5 p.m., with many set to be either reassigned or terminated.
On Tuesday, Trump released aseparate executive actiondirecting federal agencies to target the business world, and take “appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.” As part of this plan, each agency must identify up to nine potential investigations at large publicly traded corporations, nonprofits, or education institutions, among other groups. The order also says that litigation may be “potentially appropriate” to push forward with these endeavors.
Pushback against diversity efforts has been picking up steam since theSupreme Court overturned affirmative actionin 2023, and several major companies have alreadyrolled back their DEI initiatives. But Trump’s executive actions this week mark amajor escalation when it comes to attackson DEI policies both inside and outside the government. Lawyers thatFortunespoke with say that moves will undeniably bring tremendous pressure on the businesses world when it comes to their DEI practices, large companies should expect to be targeted, and they anticipate it will have a major chilling effect on the private sector.
""President Trump’s executive orders represent one of the most sweeping rollbacks of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in modern history,” says Seth J. Chandler, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center. “By targeting not only federal operations but also private contractors and federally funded institutions, these orders reshape the legal and operational landscape for corporations and universities.”
Following the Supreme Court decision tooverturn affirmative actionin 2023, several major companies, likeJohn Deere,FordandLowe’s, have already voluntarily rolled back their DEI initiatives over the past year. Several more have done the same over the past few months, includingMeta,WalmartandMcDonald’s.
But Trump’s latest presidential moves mandate government agencies to specifically target companies in the private sector engaged in what it describes as “illegal DEI discrimination and preferences.""
""The executive order is likely intended to have a chilling effect on corporate DEI, and it may encourage some companies to scale back their DEI practices,” says Andrew Turnbull, partner at law firm Morrison Foerster. “There have already been numerous reports of businesses pulling back on certain DEI programs given the mounting attacks on DEI programs. This will likely further fuel some companies to take a hard look at rolling back certain DEI programs.""
Anthony Haller, partner in Blank Rome’s labor and employment legal practice, adds that companies with DEI programs that discuss them on SEC filings are “obviously at risk for investigation.”
“The order clearly throws down the gauntlet to bring pressure across the board in the private sector, particularly with respect to public companies, because what they do and how they do it is more visible,” he says.
Many experts predict that the government may use federal contracts as a particular point of leverage for the private sector, holding off on awarding them until companies revise their DEI plans.
“The government could use the denial of contracts as a means of changing those policies,” Haller says.
Others add that government contractors and grantees will want to take special care to review their anti‑discrimination and DEI policies and programs.
“Of course, the devil is in the details,” says Turnbull, who adds that it will likely take months before any regulations or contract clause is established to implement this requirement. Inaccurate or false certifications could also subject contractors to potential liabilities under the False Claims Act, a law that imposes liability on companies (typically federal contractors) who defraud governmental programs.
Despite the intended chilling effect of these executive moves, multiple legal sources point out that Trump’s order and action do not constitute a change in the law. Rather, the language used in the order simply “enforces longstanding federal civil rights laws,” says Britney N.D. Torres, senior counsel at employment law firm Littler.
Trump’s executive moves just mean that companies will have to continue to carefully review their DEI-related policies, practices and initiatives based on longstanding anti-discrimination laws, and make sure they can't be interpreted in a way that is different from what they intended, she says.
But many companies in the private sector have already been carefully reviewing their DEI policies over the past yeas. For example, Apple’s board recently made headlines when it recommended shareholders vote against an ant-DEI policy. “Applehas a well-established compliance program and the proposal inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies,” the companywrote in an SEC filing.
“In-house counsel are well aware that complying with the law is a fundamental part of their job, and that Trump’s reelection would increase this kind of scrutiny from the government,” says Jason Solomon, director of the National Institute for Workers’ Rights, a non-profit think tank.
Despite a dramatic week, many experts thatFortunespoke with pointed out that companies have been expecting some kind of federal push against DEI since Trump won the election in November. Many have spent that time preparing for this pushback by ensuring that their programs won’t be considered illegal.
Prior to Trump’s executive missives,Costco,Apple, andMicrosofthave notably stood by their initiatives. And this week in Davos, Jamie Dimonreaffirmed JPMorgan's DEI commitmentsafter the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit, proposed the bank revisit how compensation is tied to the company's racial-equity goal.
“Bring them on,"" said Dimon referring to the efforts from right-leaning groups. ""We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.""
Legal experts anticipate more lawsuits over the next few weeks, months, and years that will pop up due to additional support from the new administration. “Bottom line, I see more litigation overall,” says Timothy J. Ford, a political law attorney at Dilworth Paxson, adding that this executive order “opens up all kinds of public and private litigation.”
Moving forward, companies may shift their approach to DEI away from focusing on supporting specific groups of people, and towards fostering a “belonging for all” ethos, says CV Viverito, director analyst of the diversity, equity, and inclusion practice for HR consulting firmGartner.
This doesn’t mean workforce diversity becomes unimportant, they note, just that it will be seen as part of a larger strategy around balanced growth in hiring, promotions and retention across demographic groups.
“Ultimately, how committed companies stay to their efforts will depend on their leadership’s commitment to DEI and whether the organization links it to real business outcomes,” they say.

US0378331005,AAPL,Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-opens-a-divide-between-us-and-eu-over-big-tech-213413056.html,04:34PM,Finviz.com,"President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.
Trump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan and Santander’s Ana Botín.
“They took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn’t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they’re after Facebook for billions and billions,” Trump said about the bloc’s regulators.
“These are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn’t be doing that. And as far as I’m concerned, it’s a form of taxation,” he added.
The EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hitApple’s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.
In March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company’s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.”
Google (GOOG,GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September,forcing the company to pay $2.7 billionfor using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over itsAndroid operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose “illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.”
In November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breachedantitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.
Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven’t escaped the EU’s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company tochange its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued astatement of objections to Microsoftover its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.
The EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.
After winning a landmarkantitrust case against Google’s search businessin August, the Department of Justice in November signaledit wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.
The DOJ has alsofiled an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.
The Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta.In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.
It further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company’s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.
In the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media companyran an illegal “buy-or-bury” schemeto either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.
The FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.
Ahead of the 2024 election,Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate’s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump’s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.
Ahead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post’s editorial board from endorsing Trump’s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.
Google and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
Altman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump’s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump’s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.
With Big Tech working to gain Trump’s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there’s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.

Meeting with officials from Apple, Google, and other smartphone companies last month, India's technology minister proposed direct user access to the government-backed software suite. Officials recommended that the applications be pre-installed on Indian-sold handsets and made accessible for download free from warnings including ""untrusted source.""
Google, whose Android operating system runs over 90% of India's around 700 million cellphones, is apparently turning down the demand. Apple is also reported to be reluctant to cooperate. The government has said it could use legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance.
Believing the GOV.in app suite might increase utilization if combined into a single package in the app stores, the ministry seeks to spread public-welfare services via technology. Right now, Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store each include separate apps.
Apple also made a similar action in 2021 in Russia, giving consumers the choice to install government-recommended applications to follow local rules.
To protect the mobile ecosystem, Google has apparently shown a readiness to work with Indian authorities.

US0378331005,AAPL,Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epic-games-kicks-off-plan-183528160.html,01:35PM,Finviz.com,"(Reuters) - ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.
The videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.
Epic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.
It will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as ""Bloons TD 6"" and ""Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee"".
The company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.
""We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,"" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.
""Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.""
North Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.
The company also offers a computer graphics software, called ""Unreal Engine"", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.
Apple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.
After getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's ""Fortnite"" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.

The Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.
""We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,"" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.
OpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.
Tech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.
Last year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the ""coming months.""

The titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.
Epic Games’ mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.
“We’re spending more money than we’re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,” he said.
Sweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.
“Apple and Google are making this really hard,” Sweeney said. “We had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.”
Sweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.
In 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker’s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.
Apple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.
“The stores’ fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,” Ball said. “Their controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.”
Sweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores “the biggest abuse of market power in modern history.”
So far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple’s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.
Under Apple’s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store’s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.
“The word for spending more money than you’re making when you have a great business underneath is ‘investment,’” Sweeney said.

US0378331005,AAPL,"Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-are-coming-and-trump-will-be-top-of-mind-for-investors-154048872.html,10:41AM,Finviz.com,"Big Tech’s earnings season kicks off this week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry’s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well underway and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new artificial intelligence models.
And looming over all of that will be how newly inaugurated President Trump will impact tech’s biggest trend in years. Whether it’s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies’ bottom lines.
Trump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday,announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the US. And on Thursday, Trumpsigned an executive orderaimed at ensuring US dominance in AI.
It’s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.
Investors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don’t end up on the wrong end of Trump’s proposedtariffs on goods from China.
Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG,GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.
There’s also the fate of the CHIPS Act. The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chipmakers, saying it was “so bad” during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election.
Without the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chipmaking facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it’s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.
In addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.
During its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn’t enough to satisfy investors,sending the company’s stock sinking 5%the day after the report.
Meta’s stock suffered a similar setbackfollowing its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 capital expenditures would increase from $37 billion-$40 billion to $38 billion-$40 billion.
Google and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.
Microsoft shares are up around 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC), which has risen 26% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 52% and 35%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 66%.
One of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.
If Trump and TikTok can’t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn but competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.
But with Trump proclaiming that he’d “save” TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”
A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two firms — Loop Capital and Jefferies — downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors.
Top Tech Stories
SK Hynix Inc.’s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025.
Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump’s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House.
President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down.
India is trying to pry open the doors of the world’s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country’s smartphones.
An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc.
Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.

US0378331005,AAPL,"Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fork-road-apple-134000191.html,09:28AM,Finviz.com,"As Apple (AAPL) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don’t see cause for concern.
“We believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone” heading into next week’s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in aresearch noteWednesday.
So far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple’s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.
Shares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.
Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’srumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.
This slide in stock price caused chipmakerNvidia to overtake Appleas the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.
But analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are “manageable,” and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple’s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.
As a result, the securities firm maintained its “Outperform” rating and $325 price target
“With Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world’s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,” Ives wrote.
Although Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple’s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant’s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a “fork in the road year” for Apple.
“Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither will Apple’s AI strategy,” Ives said. “but the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.”

(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation  Heres Why",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-thinks-apple-inc-142727898.html,09:27AM,Finviz.com,"We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
In one of his latest appearances on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump’s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, “I think that, regardless, it’s a very pro-business regime.” He explained that his view came despite “a story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].” According to Cramer, the story “is the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it’s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.”
As to Trump’s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President’s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. “Well look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down ’cause he’s going to get us to pump more,” Cramer outlined. “And I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that’s front and center,” he added. However, Cramer cautioned that “[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they’re being told, drill. I don’t think they’ll respond to that. I just don’t think that they will.”
Continuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs “more pipe[line], we’re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.” He outlined that President Trump “basically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.” Cramer believes that the move was necessary “[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don’t have a lot of what’s known as trains. We don’t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can’t ship more, as long as you don’t have a lot of, facilities. And we don’t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.”
However, one thing from Trump’s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. “So far China kind of got off the hook,” he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, “[a]nd I think that’s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.”
Another aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, “[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we’re going to put some guys in. They’re going to make a difference. It doesn’t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it’s the deep state. But you know what I’m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.”
However, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government’s operations. “It could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn’t keep up,” he shared.
He also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. “When the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,” Cramer shared. According to him, “[h]e [Biden] wasn’t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn’t like em. He didn’t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That’s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!”
Shifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok’s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, “[t]hey handed down, the only time I’ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.” He added according to the court’s opinion, it was clear that “there is a huge national security risk.”
When co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, “Right, but I’m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.” Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, “[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.  Now, I’m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.”
He also commented on whether there’s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. “There is! The Supreme Court says it’s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it’s a front door,” Cramer believes. He added, “I think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn’t use that term, but he meant it.”
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.

Consumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that’s regularly on Cramer’s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs’ death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg’s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:
“Apple’s gonna miss big. I mean I can’t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven’t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter’s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It’s really. . . .I mean AI’s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how’s Apple gonna do. And they’re gonna say it. They’re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it’s not a surprise! Okay. They’re acting like it’s, they’re acting like it’s the Commanders.
Overall, AAPLranks 2ndon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

US0378331005,AAPL,This will be a 'fork in the road year' for Apple,https://qz.com/apple-aapl-december-quarter-stock-iphone-16-ai-1851745809,08:40AM,Finviz.com,"As Apple (AAPL+1.10%) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don’t see cause for concern.
“We believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone” heading into next week’s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in aresearch noteWednesday.
So far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple’s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.
Shares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.
Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’srumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.
This slide in stock price caused chipmakerNvidia to overtake Appleas the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.
But analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are “manageable,” and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple’s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU+2.04%). Tencent (TCEHY+1.19%) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.
As a result, the securities firm maintained its “Outperform” rating and $325 price target
“With Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world’s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,” Ives wrote.
Although Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple’s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant’s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a “fork in the road year” for Apple.
“Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither will Apple’s AI strategy,” Ives said. “but the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.”

The United Kingdom’s competition regulator started a probe Thursday on the mobile ecosystems of both Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Apple (AAPL) to gauge whether the tech firms’ ownership of their apps and services makes their users pick the tech giants' products over those of rivals.
The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening probes into both firms to “determine if Apple and Google have strategic market status"" in their mobile ecosystems, which include the app stores, operating systems and browsers on these tech firms' mobile devices.
The watchdog is launching the investigation as part of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force at the start of 2025 and prevents platforms from abusing their market position to limit online competition.
Apple and Google could be made to open access for developers to their apps or make it easier for users to download or pay for in-app content from rivals, the regulator said, if the investigations find that the tech firms are favoring their own products.
The regulator said it expects to make a decision by October 2025 and that this probe is separate to an ongoing investigation into tech firms' mobile browsers and cloud gaming.
Apple and Alphabet shares were little changed in premarket trading Thursday.

US0378331005,AAPL,"UK watchdog targets Apple, Google mobile ecosystems with new digital market powers",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-watchdog-targets-apple-google-125146805.html,07:51AM,Finviz.com,"LONDON (AP) — Google's Android and Apple's iOS are facingfresh scrutinyfrom Britain's competition watchdog, which announced investigations Thursday targeting the two tech giants' mobile phone ecosystems under new powers to crack down on digital market abuses.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it launched separate investigations to determine whether the mobile ecosystems controlled by Apple and Google should be given “strategic market status” that would mandate changes in the companies' practices.
The watchdog is flexing its newly acquired regulatory muscles again after the new digital market rules took effect at the start of the year. The CMA has already used the new rules, designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies, to open an investigation into Google's search ads business.
The new investigations will examine whether Apple or Google's mobile operating systems, app stores and browsers give either company a strategic position in the market. The watchdog said it's interested in the level of competition and any barriers preventing rivals from offering competing products and services.
The CMA will also look into whether Apple or Google are favoring their own apps and services, which it said “often come pre-installed and prominently placed on iOS and Android devices.” Google's YouTube and Apple's Safari browser are two examples of apps that come bundled with Android and iOS, respectively.
And it will investigate “exploitative conduct,” such as whether Apple or Google forces app makers to agree to ""unfair terms and conditions"" as condition for distributing apps on their app stores.
The regulator has until October to wrap up the investigation. It said it could force either company to, for example, open up access to key functions other apps need to operate on mobile devices. Or it could force them to allow users to download apps outside of their own app stores.
Both Google and Apple said the work “constructively” with the U.K. regulator on the investigation.
Google said “Android’s openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratise access to smartphones and apps. It’s the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system.""
The company said it favors ""a way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.”
Apple said it “believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.""

US0378331005,AAPL,Goldman Sachs analyst tweaks Apple stock price target ahead of Q1 earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aa823ad4-8f3d-3c80-a245-bd252bcb7d33/goldman-sachs-analyst-tweaks.html,06:42AM,Finviz.com,"Updated at 10:00 a.m. EST
Apple shares edged higher in early Thursday trading, paring a move into correction territory for the world's second-largest tech stock, after Goldman Sachs analysts issued a price-target downgrade ahead of the tech giant's December-quarter earnings report next week.
Apple(AAPL)shares have fallen around 13.6% since their Boxing Day peak, shedding more than $600 billion in market value and losing its place as the world's biggest company to Nvidia(NVDA). The market move came amid concern tied to muted iPhone demand and the impact of its Apple Intelligence AI rollout.
Stiffer competition for smartphones sales in China, a key Apple market, is also weighing on the group. Data last week indicated that local rivals Huawei and Vivo secured first and second place in overall handset-market share in the world's second-largest economy last year.
International Data, which published its closely watched report on global handset sales earlier this month, said Apple's fourth-quarter deliveries fell 4.1% from the year-earlier period to around 76.9 million units.
Apple held onto its title of the world's biggest smartphone seller, however, with an estimated 18.7% share of the global market, according to IDC data, just ahead of Samsung's 18% tally.
Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng says his forecast for Apple iPhone shipments over the three months ended in December, the group's fiscal first quarter, is largely in line with IDC data. But he says that will be ""more than offset by 5% year-over-year iPhone [average selling price] growth.""
Ng expects iPhone sales rose 1% from the year-ago period, which tallied $69.7 billion, and estimates that overall group revenue advanced just under 4% to $124.2 billion.
""Services growth should continue to compound at double digits, with App Store spending expected to grow 15% and ample runway for further adoption of Apple's services,"" Ng said.
In a note published Thursday, Ng lowered his price target by $6 to $280 a share. But he maintained his buy rating on Apple stock despite it being on pace for its worst monthly performance since December 2022.
""While competition has intensified within the Chinese smartphone market, we're encouraged by the potential for accelerating iPhone growth in [the next fiscal year] driven by new product innovation for iPhone 17/18 and the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence to new markets with a more robust feature set,"" Ng said.
Related: Analyst revisits Apple stock price target ahead of Q1 earnings update
""We anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence's limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26,"" Ng and his team wrote.
In a separate note published late Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also weighed in on Apple's recent slump, calling the ""panic and bear frenzy"" around the stock ""way overdone.""
Ives, who reiterated his $325 price target on Apple stock ahead of next week's earnings, said the Apple Intelligence rollout will be ""the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world's population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years.""

""Apple Intelligence is the foundation that developers will build hundreds of apps around, and that will translate into billions of incremental services growth for Cupertino over the coming years,"" Ives said.
""What the bears continue to miss on Apple is its golden installed base of 1.5 billion iPhones and 2.3 billion iOS devices is unmatched and will create a new AI-driven growth story that [Wall] Street is not factoring into the stock,"" he added.
Apple shares were marked 0.62% higher in early Thursday trading to change hands at $225.03.

US0378331005,AAPL,Mark Zuckerberg May Be Right About Apple's Lack of Innovation. But Here's Why That Shouldn't Matter to Investors.,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/908d0759-0543-37cb-b123-a648003d24d7/mark-zuckerberg-may-be-right.html,06:42AM,Finviz.com,"Meta Platforms'CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn't a big fan ofApple(NASDAQ: AAPL). In a recent interview with podcast host Joe Rogan, he was critical of the company and its lack of innovation over the years.
And Zuckerberg really isn't necessarily wrong. Apple has been relying on making minor improvements to its iPhones and iPads over the years, and there hasn't been a major innovation from the company in a long time.
Apple definitely feels like a different company under CEO Tim Cook than it was under the late Steve Jobs. But Cook hasn't failed by any means. The business is worth well over $3 trillion today, and it could be on track to be the first company to hit a $4 trillion valuation. It hasn't come without challenges, however.
Apple hasn't been coming out with new life-changing inventions like the iPhone, but that's because those aren't easy ideas to come up with and bring to market. Investing heavily into research and development to come out with the next big tech product can be an incredibly costly endeavor, and the risk is that it may not even pay off.
Last year, Apple abandoned plans to make an electric car, a project that it was working on for a decade. There are also reports the company has recently stopped producing its Vision Pro headsets due to a lack of demand. It hasn't given up on making mixed-reality headsets, but it is rumored to be working on lower-priced options (the Vision Pro starts at $3,499) that may appeal to a wider consumer base.
The lack of innovative success might be a concern for a regular company trying to grow its sales and profits, but that isn't the case for Apple. The tech giant already has a massive customer base, and there are 2.2 billion active Apple devices in the world. Innovating new products would be a huge bonus, but it may not be necessary for the business to grow in value.
Apple's high-priced iPhones and iPads could make it difficult for consumers to justify upgrading their devices on a yearly basis or even after a couple of years. Users may not see a reason to make a big expenditure for seemingly modest improvements like enhanced cameras, better battery life, and other nominal changes it makes to its phones every year. And that's why the key to the company's long-term growth may ultimately depend on how well it can grow its services business.
In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 28, 2024, product revenue actually declined by just over 1%. While it was still massive at nearly $295 billion and it accounted for three-quarters of its overall revenue, the reason the business generated positive growth during the year was due to services.
Services revenue came in above $96 billion for the fiscal year and rose by 13%. For Apple, there's a lot more potential here to expand its offerings in the long run. It will likely be easier to convince someone to spend $20 per month for new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities on phones or other applications rather than buying a whole new phone.
In the case of AI, an upgrade may be necessary to use the latest technologies, but it can still be a more sustainable growth strategy to focus more heavily on services, which can help the company also increase its margins in the process, rather than innovating new products.
Apple may not be the excitinggrowth stockit was years ago, but the business is more stable and consistent these days. The company isn't rushing out to launch the newest AI features on its phones. Instead, it's taking a slower, measured approach to be more selective in where it invests its resources to get the best bang for its buck.
Although it's a high-priced stock and its market cap is massive at $3.5 trillion, if you're looking for an investment to hang on to for years and potentially decades, Apple looks like a solid option. With a vast user base to tap into and huge profits andfree cash flowevery year, this is a company that isn't likely to run out of ways to grow in the long term. Its valuation could mean limited returns in the short term, but if you're a buy-and-hold investor, it's hard to go wrong with Apple's stock.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a“Double Down” stockrecommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

The Competition and Markets Authority will probe whether Apple and Google’s mobile operations, including operating system, app stores and web browsers impose blocks on rival products.
The announcement comes a day after the ruling Labour Party ousted the CMA’s chair and replaced him with former Amazon.com Inc executive Doug Gurr, sending a strong signal that Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants regulators to help not hinder economic growth.
The tough new digital market rules that kicked in this month mean that the CMA can impose conduct requirements on firms that include making it easier for users to download apps and pay for content outside of Apple and Google’s own products.
Virtually all mobile devices sold in the UK are pre-installed with either iOS or Android the CMA said. “This means Apple and Google are also able to exert considerable influence over much of the content, services and technological development provided on a mobile device.”
Should companies continually fall foul of the regulations the watchdog can hand out hefty fines and impose strict remedies to boost competition.
Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.”
The CMA opened a probe into Google’s search and online ads business, the first such case where firms can be designated as having so-called strategic market status.
“Android’s openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps,” said Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director of competition. “We favor a way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for UK consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to UK growth prospects.”

US0378331005,AAPL,Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9398b728-e2cf-3609-a966-4c88c8af9087/could-this-bull-market-buy.html,05:30AM,Finviz.com,"Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)has proved itself to be a millionaire-maker in the past. The tech giant, seller of world-famous products including the iPhone and Mac, has built a solid track record of earnings growth, and that's translated into fantastic stock performance. For example, the stock has soared more than 2,900% over the past 15 years. If you'd invested $35,000 in Apple at the start of that period, your investment today would be worth more than $1 million.
So it's worth owning Apple in a bull market, a time when the market is roaring higher and favoring companies focused on growth. That said, today Apple is a well-established player so it's much more difficult for the company to deliver the double- and triple-digit growth you'll see in younger tech peers -- or in players heavily involved in a high-growth area like artificial intelligence (AI).
Considering all of this, could this bull market buy still help you become a millionaire? Let's find out.
First, let's look at why you might want to own Apple stock. As mentioned, the company has increased earnings over time thanks to growth of its market-leading products. In the latest fiscal year, ended in September, the company reported more than $391 billion in sales and $93 billion in net income. And the $94 billion in quarterly revenue was a record for that quarter amid strength in iPhone sales worldwide and record services revenue. Mac and iPad revenue also advanced during the period.
The key to Apple's success is that it's created a portfolio of products that fans love -- and they'll come back to those products even if a rival one is cheaper or a competitor releases its latest version earlier. Apple fans will wait for the latest iPhone and pay more for it. This representsa solid moat, or competitive advantage, and pricing power that's helped Apple maintain and grow its sales over time.
Even though Apple was slower than other tech giants to adopt AI, this hasn't stopped users from buying Apple products. In fact, they appreciate Apple's approach to rolling out a new technology, focusing on security and privacy.
And Apple's launch of AI features, announced in June of last year, may offer a boost to growth in the coming quarters as this new story develops. Apple Intelligence, as it's called, ""redefines privacy and AI"" Apple chief Tim Cook said during the latest earnings call. This means that any of your personal data sent into the cloud for AI processing isn't available to anyone else, not even to Apple. As for features, Apple Intelligence includes an improved AI assistant, a better photos app, various writing tools, and more.
Finally, another element that could drive a new wave of growth at Apple is linked to the work the company has done over so many years, building up its user base. The tech giant now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion active devices. And most of the people who own these devices use Apple's services. From digital content to cloud storage, these services offer the company a way to monetize each device well beyond the day the customer walks out of the store with it.
And this has helped Apple generate record services revenue quarter after quarter in recent times. It's easy to imagine that this trend will continue, and it could support more growth ahead for this tech powerhouse.
Now, let's get back to our question and consider whether Apple still could help you become a millionaire. Of course, it's important to keep in mind that Apple faces some headwinds. As mentioned, it may not attract as many investors as a smaller tech company delivering triple-digit revenue growth. And Apple faces challenges in China, the company's second biggest market after the U.S., from competition to geopolitical tension. In China, local providers such as Huawei are eating into its iPhone market share, as seen in recent sales figures. In the last quarter of the year, iPhone sales in China fell more than 18%, Bloomberg reported, citing Counterpoint Research.
Still, I think Apple's moat as well as the new growth drivers mentioned above -- and let's not forget the company's financial strength, with $108 billion infree cash flow-- should help this tech powerhouse continue to excel over time. This makes the stock a buy, but it doesn't necessarily make it a millionaire-maker, at least not on its own.
My example above showed you had to make a pretty big investment in Apple 15 years ago -- when the company was earlier in its growth story -- to make millions. Today, you probably would have to invest even more, and it's risky and unnecessary to put all of your eggs in one stock market basket. Instead, you'll increase your chances of success by diversifying across a group of quality stocks -- and be sure to include Apple, as it couldhelp you reachthat cool million over time.
Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:

The Competition and Markets Authority said it would assess whether Apple and Google had ""strategic market status"" in smartphones ecosystems, and the impact they had on users and on businesses developing content and services such as apps.
CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said more competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems.

India's consumer affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said on X on Thursday that the Central Consumer Protection Agency (CCPA) had sent notices to the companies over the alleged price disparity or ""differential pricing"".
An Uber spokesperson told Reuters, ""We do not set prices based on a rider's phone manufacturer. We look forward to working with the Central Consumer Protection Authority to clear up any misunderstanding.""
There have been several reports by local media and user complaints on social media that iPhone users were charged higher prices for the same ride than those using phones that ran on Android operating systems.
Joshi said he would direct the CCPA to also look into differential pricing strategies used by other sectors, including food delivery and online ticketing portals.
Ola, Google and Apple did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Uber is locked in a fierce battle with SoftBank-backed Ola, rival Rapido, as well as all-electric ride-hailing app BluSmart in India, one of the company's biggest markets outside the United States and Canada.
Joshi last month termed differential pricing an ""unfair trade practice"" that is a ""blatant disregard"" to consumer rights.

US0378331005,AAPL,Microsofts Growth Strategy Leaves Apple Lagging,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-growth-strategy-leaves-apple-081816865.html,03:18AM,Finviz.com,"Two leading tech companies, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), are battling for market share and investor capital. Typically, these two multibillion-dollar giants compete on software; both tend to outperform in retail and stock markets, but as of late, they’ve decoupled on their financials.
FollowTipRanks' Top Wall Street Analyststo uncover their success rate and average return.
Join thousands of data-driven investors – Build yourSmart Portfoliofor personalized insights.
As a result of my analysis, I am bullish on Microsoft and bearish on Apple because the former provides a shrewd long-term, growth-oriented capital allocation model, while the latter is overfocused on product quality and a closed ecosystem that stunts sales growth. My proprietary valuation model forecasts a 15% compound annual growth rate for MSFT over the next five years, compared to a mere 6.5% for AAPL over the same period.
Looking at the price action year-to-date,MSFT has outperformed AAPL significantlyby recording a 1.3% gain, while the iPhone maker has slumped 11.3%.
Microsoft has delivered an uptrend in its revenue growth rates over the past 10 years, rising from a 13% 10-year annualized revenue growth rate to 16.4%. Moreover, the company has increased its free cash flow from 13.9% over 10 years to a one-year rate of 14.8%.
I predominantly attribute these sturdy growth trends to CEO Satya Nadella’s leadership and the company’s shrewd positioning in cloud infrastructure, which is further compounding with the advent of AI. Furthermore, Microsoft operates a business structure that gives its divisions greater control over products and services, opening up more accretive M&A activity compared to Apple’s closed ecosystem approach.
Microsoft’s agile and financially driven capital allocation model is perhaps most powerfully illustrated byits recent $14 billion investment in OpenAI. The deal put Microsoft in a unique position to integrate ChatGPT’s capabilities into its Azure Cloud and other service offerings. In contrast to Apple, Microsoft is at the forefront of AI-model development, contributing to a far brighter long-term investment outlook.
To further illustrate how Microsoft remains agile and delivers sustained growth over time, consider that it has made 25 divestments since its first acquisition in 1986. This reveals that the company is committed to a growth strategy reliant on innovation while shedding non-core or underperforming assets.
By January 2030, I expect Microsoft to generate ~$500 billion in annual revenue, with a net margin of 37.5% and around $187.5 billion in net income. The company’s diluted share count will likely be around 7.2 billion if management maintains its existing share buyback strategy. Therefore, my diluted earnings per share estimate for MSFT stock in five years is $26.
Notably, Microsoft’sfive-year trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 33.5, equating to a fair value price of $870 in 2030. The Windows maker’s stock is currently trading around $430, inferring a five-year compound annual growth rate of 15%.
To determine the fair value of a stock, I discount my price target back to the present using the average long-term annual return of the S&P 500 (SPY), currently at 10%. This accounts for the opportunity cost of not investing in the diversified index fund. Using this method, I estimate Microsoft’s intrinsic value at $540 per share. With the current stock price at $430, this implies a margin of safety of 20%, indicating that Microsoft is undervalued relative to its five-year growth potential.
According to Wall Street analysts, Microsoft carries a Strong Buy rating based on 26 Buys and two Hold ratings. Notably, not a single analyst rated the stocks as a Sell. Theaverage MSFT price target is $507, indicating an 18.4% upside potential over the next 12 months.

In contrast to Microsoft’s healthy revenue growth rates, Apple is seeing declining rates of growth. In fact, Apple’s 10-year annualized revenue growth rate is 13.4% compared to just 4.7% over the past year, which suggests underperformance. Moreover, the iPhone maker’s free cash flow is currently down to a 12.1% annual growth rate compared to 13.7% as a 10-year average. Even if this improves somewhat in the next few years, the company is unlikely to show a long-term growth uptrend.
As Apple’s growth tapers off, end-user consumers and investors are wising up to the fact that Apple’s flagship product — the iPhone — struggles to generate the margins it once did now that the smartphone market has saturated. To fight back against a rising tide, Apple is focusing on emerging markets and breaking ground in less lucrative segments to rediscover its successes from yesteryear. As a brief case in point, iPhone sales fell by 2% in 2024 while the global smartphone market grew by 4%.
Meanwhile,in the largest consumer market in the world, China, the iPhone has been overtaken by savvier peerssuch as Huawei and Vivo, thereby eroding Apple’s market share over time and directly proving that Apple’s once-held smartphone dominance is over. In 2024, Apple’s iPhone sales in China declined by 17% as competitors banked market share at Apple’s expense.
Given the stagnation in core product growth, I am bearish on Apple in the medium-long term. My sentiment is further corroborated by Apple’s toppy valuation, suggesting the company is now heavily dependent on intangibles for its short and long-term success.
I forecast Apple to post revenues in the region of $570 billion with a net margin of 25% within five years. If correct, this equates to a net annual income of $142.5 billion. Given management’s heavy share buyback strategy, Apple will likely have around 13.5 billion diluted shares outstanding in five years, which suggests Apple will end up with diluted earnings per share of ~$10 in 2030.
Also, I considerApple’s price-to-earnings ratio of 37.5to be too high and well above its five-year average. Assuming a P/E ratio of 30, Apple’s expected share price in 2030 would be around $315.
Apple is currently trading at approximately $220 per share, which implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% in my model. By discounting my price target to the present using the long-term yearly average return of the S&P 500 (10% as the discount rate), I calculate Apple’s intrinsic value to be $195 per share. With the current stock price at $220, the margin of safety is negative at -13%, indicating that the market is overvaluing Apple relative to its five-year growth potential.
Turning to Wall Street, Apple has a Moderate Buy rating based on 19 Buy, seven Hold, and three Sell ratings. Theaverage AAPL price targetis $244.36, indicating an 11% upside potential over the next 12 months.
See more AAPL analyst ratings
Consumers and investors alike have realized that Apple’s bullish run is slowing. Both as a short-term speculative trade or a long-term investment, MSFT is currently better positioned than AAPL for sustained investor returns through 2025 and beyond. My valuation model points to a distinct advantage for MSFT, wielding a 15% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, compared to a mere 6.5% for AAPL. Once other capital-related, operational, and analytical factors are factored in, Microsoft stands out as the clear investment case winner over Apple in early 2025.

US0378331005,AAPL,Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a4bdd9a5-aa7f-3b7e-9666-c760f66ca61e/could-nvidia-unseat-apple-as.html,03:12AM,Finviz.com,"Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)andApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.
Notably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.
As hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atopthe list of the world's most valuable companieslooks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of ""world's most valuable company"" this year.
Nvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand forAI technologieshas spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.
Apple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.
Apple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.
Over the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.
Nvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.
For comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.
In order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.
In contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of ""world's most valuable company"" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.

Southeast Asia’s largest country banned the sale of the new device in October, saying Apple had failed to comply with domestic manufacturing requirements for smartphones and tablets. The company has been in discussions with the government over an investment package that would lift the restrictions.
“I strongly believe it will resolve very, very soon,” Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos on Tuesday. “Hopefully within one or two weeks this issue can be resolved.”
Apple’s latest $1 billion offer for one of its suppliers to set up a plant to produce airtags in the country was rejected by the Minister for Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, Bloomberg reported in January. He told Apple’s vice-president for global affairs Nick Ammann and the Apple delegation that the US company needed to fulfill a local regulation that requires it to make part of its iPhone, or the iPhone’s components, onshore.
“The way they calculate it is different I think,” Roeslani said, referring to the local content requirement. “Now they find a solution on that one, so hopefully they accept the discrepancies so we can have the iPhone 16 sold in Indonesia.”

US0378331005,AAPL,"Exclusive-India watchdog faults probe of Foxconn hiring, orders new inquiry",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-india-watchdog-faults-probe-044822168.html,Jan-22-25 11:48PM,Finviz.com,"By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's powerful human rights watchdog has admonished labor officials for failure to adequately investigate evidence of employment discrimination at Foxconn, which makes Apple iPhones, and told them to re-examine the matter, documents show.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in June ordered federal and Tamil Nadu state officials to probe Foxconn's hiring practices, after a Reuters investigation found the manufacturer excluded married women from iPhone assembly jobs at its southern India plant. Foxconn relaxed the ban during high-production periods, Reuters found.
The iPhone factory is a flagship foreign investment in India, crucial to Apple and Foxconn's plans to grow manufacturing in the country, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aim of rivaling China in electronics production.
Indian labor officials visited the Foxconn plant in July and questioned executives about employment practices, but did not make their findings public.
Reuters this month reviewed NHRC case files related to the probe after the news agency sought the records under India's Right to Information laws. The details have not been previously reported.
An undated NHRC case status document shows Tamil Nadu labor officials told the commission on July 5 that 6.7% of the 33,360 women working at the Foxconn plant were married, without specifying whether they were on the assembly line. They said women employed at the factory came from six districts, ""which makes it clear that a large number of female employees have been hired by the company ... without any discrimination.""
The federal investigators told the commission they had interviewed 21 married women at the factory, who said they faced no discrimination over wages and promotions, according to the document.
In response, the NHRC told the labor officials in November that they did not appear to have scrutinized Foxconn hiring documents, nor addressed the core issue of discrimination against married women in recruitment. The officials had relied on current employees' testimony and ""filed their reports in a routine/casual manner,"" according to the case details.
""The presence of (a) certain number of female employees at present does not answer the question (of) whether the company had actually discriminated against the married women at the time of recruitment,"" the NHRC said, noting the labor officials were ""apparently silent in this regard.""
""The commission has no hesitation in stating that the authorities concerned have failed to identify and understand the core issue.""
Neither the state nor federal labor departments responded to Reuters requests for comment about the NHRC's assessment. In calling for the investigations in June, Modi's government said India's Equal Remuneration Act stipulates that there should be no discrimination in the recruitment of men and women.
Apple and Foxconn also did not respond to questions about the correspondence. Both companies have previously said that Foxconn hires married women in India.
The NHRC is a statutory body with powers akin to a civil court. It can investigate human rights violations, summon officials and recommend remedial actions, including compensation payments.
Last year, the watchdog asked India's federal labor department to look into reports of harsh working conditions at an Amazon warehouse near New Delhi. Amazon subsequently said it conducted an investigation and took remedial action.
In the Foxconn case, the NHRC files show the agency conveyed its dissatisfaction to government officials on Nov. 19, and ordered them to re-examine the matter by carrying out ""a thorough investigation"" within four weeks.
The NHRC in its Jan. 10 response to Reuters said it could not provide further information as the case was ongoing.
Reuters' investigation into Foxconn's hiring practices was based on interviews with current and former executives, recruitment agents and job candidates, and a review of job advertisements circulated by the hiring vendors who help recruit smartphone assembly workers in India.
Many ads posted between January 2023 and May 2024 stated that only unmarried women of specified ages were eligible for smartphone assembly roles, contravening Apple and Foxconn anti-discrimination policies.
Reuters reported in November that Foxconn had ordered the recruiters to remove age, gender and marital criteria in job ads.

We recently compiled a list of the11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.
With only a few days in, President Donald Trump’s administration has been making significant strides in advancing artificial intelligence technology.Reutersreported on Tuesday that he has announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outperform rival nations in the critical technology.
READ NOW:10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings
In this regard, Trump has also emphasized the importance of keeping the technology within the country.
“What we want to do is we want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor, and others are competitors… It’s technology and artificial intelligence all made in the USA”.
-Trump said in remarks at the White House.
According to Trump, ChatGPT’s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, are planning a joint venture called Stargate. The venture is expected to build data centers and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. With other equity backers, these companies have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment. Meanwhile, the remaining investment will occur over the next four years.
Following the news, global shares rose today, January 22nd, driven by a rise in technology stocks. Even though the global market is near record highs, investors are optimistic that they may rise even further.
“We prefer taking risk in stocks and expect corporate earnings to keep driving returns as the fourth-quarter reporting season starts”.
-Jean Boivin, the head of BlackRock Investment Institute.
He also noted that Treasury yields might jump.
“We are in a world of higher interest rates and expect them to stay above pre-pandemic levels. Even with the jump in yields, we still see more room to run, if at a slower pace”.
Speaking of the Stargate initiative, OpenAI’s Sam Altman is also thrilled that they get “to do this in the United States of America”. He thinks this is going to be the most important project of this era. Moreover, according to multiple news sources, the move may signal that the Trump administration will be striving to work with some tech companies.
After all, the President has been proactive in advancing AI technology. One of the first moves that he took returning to office has been to revoke a Biden-era executive order regarding AI guardrails. Overall, spending and focus on artificial intelligence in the US is in full swing. Billionaire businessman Hussain Sajwani also pledged to spend $20 billion or more on AI data centers in the U.S. earlier this month.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. On January 20, Jefferies told investors to dump Apple stock. The analysts warned of a potentially weak revenue number from the technology giant. In this respect, analyst Edison Lee downgraded shares to “Underperform” from “Hold” and also cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. Besides highlighting some financial concerns, Lee has also dubbed Apple’s outlook for artificial intelligence “subdued”. The analyst stated that this could be a concern for market participants who have been focusing on the potential of the technology for more than a year. Therefore, this toned-down AI interest is responsible for the weak revenue. The firm also highlighted poor iPhone sales as a cause. According to CNBC, Lee’s rating downgrade is out of line considering nineteen analysts say to buy Apple and six say it’s a hold, according to Tipranks.com.
Overall AAPLranks 2ndon our list of the AI stocks that should be on your watchlist. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The company previewed a handset called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event — with the focus firmly on artificial intelligence features and not much in the way of major hardware upgrades — the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.
The move sets up a revival of the race to create the slimmest possible smartphone, which had died down when manufacturers focused on adding more camera technology to their devices. Apple is also expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years.
Samsung’s S25 Edge will add a fourth model to its newly unveiled flagship Galaxy S25 family of devices, which deliver a suite of new AI features and voice commands. Pairing Alphabet Inc.’s Google Gemini with its own on-device AI, Samsung has made leadership in mobile AI an overarching priority.
“Launching new flagship smartphones has become a considerable headache for all the leading manufacturers,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. “Top-end products are now so good that it’s extremely difficult to deliver any meaningful differentiation from one year to the next. It’s little surprise that phone makers are hoping that a little ‘AI magic dust’ will help turn consumers’ heads, but that’s proving to be a tough sell too.”
The company plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of its mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in an interview. It’ll be a busy year for Samsung, as the company is also working with Google on delivering a mixed-reality headset, dubbed Project Moohan, and is developing augmented reality glasses using the same new software, Android XR.
The Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the “best performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,” Roh said in the interview.
“We’ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,” he said.
For Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device’s history.
Roh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.
Roh said the company has “high expectations for this product.” Samsung hasn’t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.
“Our goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it’s more accessible and has more customers,” Roh said.
